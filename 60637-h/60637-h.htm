<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h2>

<p>A large proportion of the most interesting quotations in this
book was collected between 1874 and 1886. During that period
I was under the influence of Richard Hodgson, who was my
close friend from childhood. To him directly and indirectly
this book is largely indebted.</p>

<p>Hodgson (1855-1905) had a remarkably pure, noble, and
lovable character, and was one of the most gifted men Australia
has produced. He is known in philosophic circles from some early
contributions to <i>Mind</i> and other journals, but is mainly known
from his work in psychical research, to which he devoted the best
years of his life. Apart from his great ability in other directions,
he was endowed, even in youth, with fine taste and a clear and
mature literary judgment. This will appear to some extent in
the quotations over his name, and the note on <a href="#Page_208">p. 208</a> will give
further particulars of his career. He was from two to three years
older than myself, and guided me in my early reading. Therefore,
indirectly, he has to do with most of the contents of this
book.</p>

<p>But, more than this, about one-third of the main quotations
(not including the notes which I have only now added) came direct
from Hodgson. He left Australia in 1877, but we maintained
a voluminous correspondence until 1886. This correspondence
contained most of the quotations referred to, and the remainder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
Hodgson gave me in London on the only occasion I met him after
he left Australia. (After 1886 he became so immersed in
psychical research, and I in legal work, that our correspondence
ceased to be of a literary character.) Thus directly and indirectly
Hodgson has much to do with the book—and, if it had been
practicable, I would have placed his name on the title-page.</p>

<p>This book is simply one to be taken up at odd moments, like
any other collection of quotations. But there are two reasons
why it may have some special interest. One reason is that it
includes passages from a number of authors who appear to have
become forgotten, or, at any rate, to be passing Lethe-wards.
We, who dwell in the underworld,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> cannot, of course, have a
complete knowledge of what is known or forgotten in the inner
literary circles of England. We can depend only on the books
and periodicals that happen to come to our hands, and perhaps
should not rely too much on such sources of information. Yet
I cannot but think that Robert Buchanan, for example, has
become largely forgotten, and apparently this is the case also
with a number of other authors from whom I quote. Because of
this, I have retained all the passages I had from such authors.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that this book is not an anthology.
A commonplace book is usually a collection of <i>reminders</i> made
by a young man who cannot afford an extensive library. There
is no system in such a collection. A book is borrowed and
extracts made from it; another book by the same author is <i>bought</i>
and no extract made from it. On the one hand a favourite verse,
although well known, is written out for some reason or other;
on the other hand hundreds of beautiful poems are omitted.
So far from this being an anthology, I have, as a matter of course,
omitted many poems that since the seventy-eighty period have
become general favourites; and, as regards the most beautiful
gems of our literature, they are almost all excluded. There are
for example, only a few lines from Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Some exceptions have, however, been made. In a series of
word-pictures, a few of the best-known passages will be found.
A few others have been included for reasons that will readily
appear; they either form part of a series or the reason is apparent
from the notes. Apart from these I have retained Blanco
White’s great sonnet and “The Night has a thousand eyes,”
written by F. W. Bourdillon when an undergraduate at Worcester
College, Oxford, because with regard to these I had an interesting
and instructive experience. I accidentally discovered that of four
well-read men (two at least of them more thorough students<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
of poetry than myself) two were ignorant of the one poem and
two of the other. Seeking an explanation, I turned to the anthologies.
I could not find in any of them Bourdillon’s little gem
until I came to the comparatively recent <i>Oxford Book of Victorian
Verse</i> and <i>The Spirit of Man</i>. The Blanco White sonnet I could
find <i>nowhere</i> except in collections of sonnets, which in my opinion
are little read. It will be observed that in anthologies alone can
Blanco White’s one and only poem be kept alive.</p>

<p>The second reason why this book may have a special interest is
that it may serve as a reminder to my contemporaries of our stirring
thoughts and experiences in the seventies and eighties. How
interesting this period was it is difficult to show in a few lines.
In pure literature, books of value simply poured from the press.
In the closing year, 1889, “One who never turned his back,
but marched breast forward” died on the day that his last book,
<i>Asolando</i>, was published, leaving Tennyson, an old man of eighty,
the sole survivor of the poets of a great period. At almost the
same moment “Crossing the Bar” was published.</p>

<p>Apart from literature, the seventies and eighties were an
eventful period in science and religion. Darwinism was still
causing its tremendous upheaval, and the supposed conflict
between religion and science exercised an enormous effect on the
minds of men. Evolution had explained so much of the processes
in the history of life, that the <i>majority</i> of thinkers at that time
imagined that no room was left for the super-natural. Science
was supposed to have given a death-blow to religion, and the
greatest wave of materialism ever known in the history of the
world swept over England and Europe. It is strange how many
great thinkers missed what now appears so obvious a fact, that
causality still stood behind all law, and that Darwin, like Newton,
had merely helped to show the method by which the universe
is governed. (It seems to me that James Martineau stood supreme
at that time as a man of genius who saw clearly the inherent
defect of the whole materialist movement.)</p>

<p>However, agnosticism, materialism, positivism flourished and
triumphed. Science, whose dignity had been so long unrecognized,
came into her own, and, in her turn, usurped the same
dogmatic superior attitude she had resented in ecclesiasticism.
On the one hand pessimistic literature and philosophy poured
from the press; on the other hand new religions arose to take
the place of the old. Theosophy and spiritualism were in evidence
everywhere (leading in 1882 to the happy result that the Society
for Psychical Research was founded). Harrison, Clifford, Swinburne
and others preached the deification of man. There were
discords within, as well as foes without the church. The severely
orthodox fought against the revelations of Colenso and the higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
criticism; Seeley’s <i>Ecce Homo</i> and a host of other works
aroused fierce antagonism; Pius IX, who had in 1864 published
his Syllabus which would have destroyed modern civilization,
proclaimed the infallibility of the Pope in 1870—and in 1872
was deprived of temporal power. Such questions as the literal
interpretation and inerrancy of the Bible were the subjects of
intense conflict—and especially strange is it to remember the
dire struggle of well-intentioned men to maintain the horrible
doctrine of eternal punishment. I imagine that this book
will assist to some extent in recalling the atmosphere and aroma
of that remarkable period.</p>

<p>I have made very little attempt to arrange my quotations—and
now wish I had done less in that direction. The book
is intended for casual reading, and to arrange it under headings
would tend to make it <i>heavy</i>. The element of surprise is more
calculated to make the book attractive.</p>

<p>I began the notes that are appended to some of the quotations
with the intention of giving only such short, necessary explanations
as would be of assistance to the inexperienced reader.
When, however, I began to write, I found my pen running away
with me. Apart from the usual, ineffectual efforts of one’s
youth, I had never before attempted literary work, and for the
first time experienced the great pleasure there is in such writing.
With the immense variety of subjects in a collection of quotations,
one could continue to write over a series of years; but it was
necessary to keep the book within reasonable bounds, and, therefore,
I had arbitrarily to come to a stop. In these notes I do not
claim that there is much, if any, originality,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> they are mostly
recollections of old reading. Still they may serve the important
purpose of revivifying old truths (<a href="#Page_78">see p. 78</a>).</p>

<p>I have been astonished at the great deal of work this book
has involved—and also how much I have needed the assistance
of my friends. There were some sixty or seventy quotations
in respect to which I had neglected to give any reference to the
authors (for the same reason as one did not put the names on
photographs of old friends—it seemed impossible that the names
could be forgotten). The difficulty of finding even one such
quotation is enormous, and we have no British Museum in Adelaide,
but only some limited public libraries. However, with the help
of my friends I have succeeded in tracing the paternity of most
of these “orphans.” In this and other directions I have had
the kind assistance of many gentlemen. Of these first and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
foremost comes Mr. G. F. Hassell, the publisher of the Adelaide
edition, who, in his devotion to literature as well as to his own
art of printing, is a worthy representative of the old Renaissance
printers. He has given me every assistance, has gone through
every line, and, as he is both an exceedingly well-read man and
also of a younger generation than myself, I have left it to him
to decide what should be omitted and what retained in this book.
Professor Mitchell has also been so kind as to revise and make
suggestions concerning a number of notes on philosophic and
other subjects. Professor Darnley Naylor has been uniformly
good in revising any notes of a classical nature—though he takes
no responsibility whatever for the views I express. Dr. E.
Harold Davies has also helped me with two notes on music,
in one instance correcting a serious mistake I had made. Sir
Langdon Bonython, my friend of many years, has assisted
me with practical as well as literary suggestions, and has thrown
open his library to me. Mr. Francis Edwards, of High Street,
Marylebone, has assisted in my search for references to quotations.
Mr. H. Rutherford Purnell, Public Librarian of Adelaide, and his
staff have helped me throughout, and Mr. E. La Touche Armstrong,
Public Librarian of Melbourne, has gone to great trouble
on my account. Miss M. R. Walker has assisted me in various
ways, and especially in preparing the very difficult Index of
Subjects. Mr. Sydney Temple Thomas has lent me a number
of important books I specially required. Others who have
helped me in one way or another are two English friends, Mrs.
Caroline Sidgwick and Mrs. Rachael Bray, Messrs. J. R. Fowler,
H. W. Uffindell, S. Talbot Smith and Dr. J. W. Browne, of
Adelaide, Professor Dettmann of New Zealand, Professor Hyslop
of New York and Mr. F. C. Govers of the State War Council,
Sydney.</p>

House. Mr. Martin Seeker joins in the consent given by Mr.
Squire for the extract from his poems. I thank the Editor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
of the Contemporary Review for quotations from the writings
of Professor A. Bain and the Rev. R. F. Littledale; and the
Editor of the Nineteenth Century for some lines by W. M.
Hardinge (Greek Anthology) and an article on Multiplex
Personality. I thank also the Society for Psychical Research
for an obituary article by F. W. H. Myers on Gladstone, printed
in the Journal of that Society.</p>

<p>For any unintentional omissions, oversights, or failures to trace
rights I beg to tender my apologies. The distance of Adelaide

<h2>PREFACE<br />
<span class="smaller"><span class="smaller">TO THE</span><br />
SECOND ENGLISH EDITION.</span></h2>

<p>In preparing this edition I have made a great number of more
or less important corrections, alterations and additions. Most of
these occupy only a few lines apiece and, although none call for
special mention, they should together add to the interest and
usefulness of this book. For a number of them I am indebted to
Mr. Vernon Rendall, formerly editor of the <i>Athenæum</i> and <i>Notes
and Queries</i>. With his wonderfully wide and exact knowledge of
English and classical literature, he gave me much assistance and
I am grateful to him.</p>

<p>The issue of a Second Edition enables me to thank my friend,
Sir John Cockburn, for his truly remarkable kindness to me.
When I sent this book home from Adelaide to be published, he
undertook the heavy work of seeking the consent of the numerous
copyright owners, negotiating with publishers, and seeing
the book through the press. Only those who are experienced in
such matters can realize the <i>enormous</i> amount of time and labour
that all this involved. It is impossible for me to express
adequately my obligations to my friend. He did not include any
reference to himself in the original Preface, in spite of my
insistence by letter and cable.</p>

<p>In associating his name with this book, I am bound to add
that Sir John disagrees with and, therefore, disapproves of much
that I have said in some notes on the Ancient Greeks.</p>

<p>This has presumably to be called a new edition, rather than a

these are not numerous, and the only ones to which I need call
special attention are the substituted verses on <a href="#Page_153">pp. 153-5</a>.</p>

<p>Do not imagine that you are fighting about a single issue, freedom
or slavery. You have an empire to lose, and are exposed to danger
by reason of the hatred which your imperial rule has inspired
in other states. And you cannot resign your power, although
some timid or unambitious spirits want you to act justly. For
now your empire has become a <i>despotism</i>, a thing which in the
opinion of mankind has been unjustly acquired yet cannot be
safely relinquished. The men of whom I speak, if they could
find followers, would soon ruin the state, and, if they were to
found a state of their own, would just as soon ruin that.</p>

<p class="attribution">(<i>Speech by Pericles.</i>)</p>

<p>I have observed again and again that a democracy cannot
govern an empire; and never more clearly than now, when I see
you regretting the sentence you pronounced on the Mityleneans.
Having no fear or suspicion of one another, you deal with your
allies on the same principle. You do not realize that, whenever
you yield to them out of pity, or are prevailed on by their pleas,
you are guilty of a weakness dangerous to yourselves and receive
no gratitude from them. You need to bear in mind that your
empire is a <i>despotism</i> exercised over unwilling subjects who are
ever conspiring against you. They do not obey because of any
kindness you show them: they obey just so far as you show yourselves
their masters. They have no love for you, but are held
down by force....</p>

<p>You must not be misled by pity, or eloquent pleading or by
generosity. There are no three things more fatal to empire.</p>

<p>It will be seen that these odious sentiments are attributed by the

The Greeks were fervent supporters of Democracy and Equality, but not

<p>These are the times that try men’s souls. The summer soldier
and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service
of their country; but he, that stands it <i>now</i>, deserves the love
and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily
conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder
the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain
too cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives
anything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price
upon its goods; and it would be strange indeed if so celestial
an article as FREEDOM should not be highly rated.</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Thomas Paine</span> (1776).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>Outside the Bible and other books of religion, I think it would be difficult
to find any single passage in the world’s literature that produced so wonderful
a result as the above passage of Tom Paine’s. It was the opening
paragraph of the first number of <i>The Crisis</i>, and was written by miserable,
flaring candle-light, when Paine was a private in Washington’s ill-clad,
worn-out army at Trenton. The soldiers, who were then despairing from
hardship and defeat, were roused by these words to such enthusiasm that
next day they rushed bravely in and won the first American victory, which
turned the tide of the war of independence.</p>

<p>Previously to this, it was through Paine’s pamphlet, <i>Common Sense</i>,
that the Americans first saw that separation was the only remedy for their
grievances. Conway tells an amusing story about <i>Common Sense</i> and <i>The
Rights of Man</i>. When the Bolton town crier was sent round to seize these
prohibited books, he reported that he could not find any Rights of Man
or Common Sense anywhere!</p>

<p>For trying to save the life of Louis XVI during the revolution, Paine
was thrown into the Bastille, and only escaped death by a curious accident.
It was customary for chalk-marks to be made on the cell-doors of those
to be guillotined the following morning, and these doors opened outwards.
When Paine’s door was marked, it happened to be open, and the mark
was made on the inside, so that, when the door was shut, the mark was not
visible. If Paine had not been a sceptic, this would have been described
in those days as a wonderful interposition of Providence!</p>

<p>Conway lays a terrible indictment against Washington. When Paine,
whose services to America, and to Washington himself, had been so magnificent,
was thrown into the Bastille, Washington could have saved him by
a word—but remained silent! This was no doubt the reason why Paine,
after his liberation, was led to make an unjust attack on Washington’s
military and Presidential work. It was due to this attack on Washington
and the bigotry of the time against the author of <i>The Age of Reason</i>, that
Paine fell utterly into disrepute.</p>

<p>When the Centenary of American independence was celebrated by an
Exhibition at Philadelphia, a bust of Paine was offered to the city by his
admirers, but was promptly declined! And yet Conway says that on the
day, whose centenary was then being celebrated, Paine was idolized in
America above all other men, Washington included.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing notes were made on reading an article on Paine by Moncure
D. Conway in <i>The Fortnightly</i>, March, 1879. I think the fact mentioned
in the last paragraph and the town-crier story do not appear in Conway’s
subsequent <i>Life of Paine</i>.</p>

<p>Even at the present day bigotry seems to prevent any proper recognition
of Paine’s fine character and important work. (The unpleasant
flippancy<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> with which he dealt with serious religious questions is no doubt
partly the cause of this.) I find very inadequate appreciation of him in
<i>The Americana</i> and <i>The Biographical Dictionary of America</i>—and also in
our own <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>. The general impression among
the public still probably is that Paine was an atheist; as a matter of fact,
he was a Theist, and his will ends with the words, “I die in perfect composure
and resignation to the will of my Creator, God.”</p>

<p>Carlyle’s reference to Paine is amusing: “Nor is our England without
her missionaries. She has her Paine: rebellious staymaker; unkempt;
who feels that he, a single needleman, did, by his <i>Common-Sense</i> Pamphlet,
free America—that he can and will free all this World; perhaps even the
other.” (<i>French Revolution.</i>)</p>

<p>Of the verses in this fine poem which speak for the various British
Dominions I take only the one that represents my own country. At the
time Kipling wrote, the inhabitants of our beloved mother-country did not
seem to fully realize that we were their kindred—that our fern and clematis
made <i>English posies</i>—but no doubt their feeling has altered since we
have fought side by side in mutual defence. However, to us England was

<p>The Greek Anthology is a collection of about 4,500 short poems by
about 300 Greek writers, extending over a period of one thousand seven
hundred years, from, say, 700 B.C. to 1000 A.D. At first these poems were
epigrams—using the word “epigram” in its original sense, as a verse
intended to be inscribed on a tomb or tablet in memory of some dead
person or important event. Later they included poems on any subject,
so long as they contained one fine thought couched in concise language.
Still later any short lyric was included.</p>

<p>This wonderful collection forms a great treasure-house of poetry,
which gives much insight into the Greek life of the time, and it also largely
influenced English and European literature. For instance, the first verse
of Ben Jonson’s “Drink to me only with thine eyes,” is taken direct from the
Anthology (Agathias, <i>Anth. Pal.</i>, V., 261). I may add that the second
verse, in which the poet sends the wreath, not as a compliment to the lady
but as a kindness to the roses which could not wither if worn by her, is
also borrowed from a Greek source. (Philostratus, <i>Epistolai Erotikai</i>.)</p>

<p>Numberless English and European scholars have attempted the difficult
task of translating or paraphrasing these little poetic gems into correspondingly
poetic and concise language, but the beauty of the original
can never be fully retained.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="notes">

<p>Hugues of Saxe-Gotha is an imaginary name, but it probably indicates
the great Sebastian Bach, who came from that part of Germany. The
“masterpiece, hard number twelve,” referred to in the poem, may be
(Dr. E. Harold Davies tells me) the great Organ Fugue in F Minor, which is
in “five part” counter-point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>This very interesting poem is written in a half-humorous fashion, but
its intention is quite serious. In a wonderfully imitative manner,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> it
describes the wrangling and disputing in a five-voiced fugue (where five persons
appear to be taking part):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">One is incisive, corrosive;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Two retorts, nettled, curt, crepitant;</div>
<div class="verse">Three makes rejoinder, expansive, explosive;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Four overbears them all, strident and strepitant:</div>
<div class="verse">Five ... O Danaïdes, O Sieve!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(For killing their husbands the fifty Danaïdes were doomed to pour
water everlastingly into a sieve.)</p>

<p>“Where in all this is the music?” asks Browning. And, although
he is writing humorously, yet, however rank the heresy, he finds that the
fugue, with its elaborate counterpoint, is wanting in the essentials of true
art. He prefers Palestrina’s simpler and more emotional mode of expression:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Hugues! I advise <i>meâ poenâ</i><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></div>
<div class="verse indent1">(Counterpoint glares like a Gorgon)</div>
<div class="verse">Bid One, Two, Three, Four, Five, clear the arena!</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Say the word, straight I unstop the full-organ,</div>
<div class="verse">Blare out the <i>mode Palestrina</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the poem, where occurs the passage quoted, one can vividly follow
the poet’s thought. Music is essentially the language of feeling, of <i>emotion</i>;
the fugue is a triumph of <i>invention</i>, and, therefore, the result of <i>intellect</i>.
Feeling is elemental, simple, and unanalysable. The subtleties of pure
harmony are the expression of deepness and richness of feeling; the intricacies
of the fugue are artificially constructed and, therefore, unsuited
to the expression of pure emotion. They represent intellect as against
feeling. And essentially in the moral world, but also in our general outlook
upon truth and nature, the spiritual perception is derived from simple
human emotion rather than intellect; “Thou hast hid these things from
the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.” (The whole
of Browning’s poetry teaches that love, not intellect, is the solution of all
moral problems, and the goal of the universe.)</p>

<p>In the poem the organist has been playing on the organ in an old church;
and Browning suddenly sees an illustration of his thought in the fine gilded
ceiling covered by thick cobwebs. The cobwebs that obscure the gold
of the ceiling are the intellectual wranglings that destroy music in the fugue—and
both are symbolical of what occurs in our lives. Truth and Nature,
“God’s gold”—the pure, simple truths of the higher life—are over us,
bright and clear as the noon-day sun. But by doubts and disputations,
warring philosophies and contending creeds, by strife over non-essentials,
casuistries, self-deceptions, by questions of dogma (often as fine as any
spider’s web), by endless “comments and glozes,” we lose sight of the
elemental truths and clear principles that should guide our lives. The pure
and simple-hearted reach the Mount of Vision: to them comes the clear
sense of Love and Duty. Those of us who turn our intellects to a perverse
use and exclude the spiritual perception of the soul are like the spiders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
who cover up “stars and roses, Cherub and trophy and garland.” We
obscure and forget all noble ideals, abolish God’s high “legislature,” and
follow a lawless life of selfish passion and sordid ambitions. The Good and
Beautiful and True have been obliterated and forgotten; “God’s gold”
is tarnished, His harmonies lost in discord; and we become morally dead.</p>

<p>(Referring to the Gorham case) The future historian of
opinion will write of us in this strain: “The people who spoke the
language of Shakespeare were great in the constructive arts: the
remains of their vast works evince an extraordinary power of combining
and economizing labour: their colonies were spread over
both hemispheres, and their industry penetrated to the remotest
tribes: they knew how to subjugate nature and to govern men:
but the weakness of their thought presented a strange contrast
to the vigour of their arm; and though they were an earnest
people, their conceptions of human life and its Divine Author
seems to have been of the most puerile nature. Some orations
have been handed down—apparently delivered before one of
their most dignified tribunals—in which the question is discussed:
‘In what way the washing of new-born babes according to certain
rules prevented God’s hating them.’ The curious feature is,
that the discussion turns entirely upon the manner in which this
wetting operated; and no doubt seems to have been entertained
by disputants, judges, or audience, that, without it, a child or
other person dying would fall into the hands of an angry Deity, and
be kept alive for ever to be tortured in a burning cave. Now,
all researches into the contemporary institutions of the island
show that its religion found its chief support among the classes
possessing no mean station or culture, and that the education
for the priesthood was the highest which the country afforded.
This strange belief must be taken, therefore, as the measure,
not of popular ignorance, but of their most intellectual faith.
A philosophy and worship embodying such a superstition can
present nothing to reward the labour of research.”</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">James Martineau</span> (<i>Essay on “The Church of England”</i>).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>In the Gorham case, which went on appeal to the Privy Council, it
was decided that Mr. Gorham’s beliefs, although unusual, were not repugnant
to the doctrines of the Church of England. His views were that
baptism is generally necessary to salvation, that it is a sign of grace by which
God works in us, but only in those who worthily receive it. In others it
is not effectual. Infants baptized who die before actual sin are certainly
saved, but regeneration does not necessarily follow on baptism.</p>

<p>In such matters one question stands out very prominently. The
priest is consecrated to the high office of teaching the eternal truths of
Christ—Love and Duty and Moral Aspiration. How can he keep those
truths in due perspective when his intellect is engaged in warfare over
miserable casuistries.</p>

<p>And as the strife waxes fiercer among the priests of the Most High,
they call in the aid of hired mercenaries. Think of the lawyers paid by
one side or the other to argue questions of baptism and prevenient grace!
It was precisely this introduction into religion of legal formalism and technicality,
the arguing from texts and ancient commentaries, the verbal
quibbling and hair-splitting, the “letter” that “killeth” as against the
“spirit” that “giveth life,” which led to Christ’s bitter invectives against
the “Scribes” or lawyers of His day.</p>

<p>Seeley, in <i>Ecce Homo</i>, points out that when Christ summoned the
disciples to him, he required from them only Faith, and not belief in any
specific doctrines. As it was not until later that they learnt He was to
suffer death and rise again, they could at first have held no belief in the
Atonement or the Resurrection. “Nor,” says Seeley, “do we find Him
frequently examining His followers in their creed, and rejecting one as
a sceptic and another as an infidel.... Assuredly those who represent
Christ as presenting to man an abstruse <i>theology</i>, and saying to them peremptorily:
‘Believe or be damned,’ have the coarsest conception of the Saviour
of the world.”</p>

<p>This is George MacDonald’s translation (but never can a translation
of poetry reproduce the original). MacDonald says of the poem: “This
is true concerning every form in which truth is embodied, whether
it be sight or sound, geometric diagram or scientific formula. Unintelligible,
it may be dismal enough regarded from the outside; prismatic in its revelation
of truth from within.” Among the arts this statement is most
applicable to poetry, and hence the reason why notes are often required
to assist many persons to “come inside,” to enter into the heart of a poem—to
reach the point of vision.</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>This parody on Bret Harte’s “Plain Language from Truthful James”
was written at the time when the Browning Society at Keble College, Oxford,
came to an end—apparently, according to these verses, because its funds
had been exhausted in afternoon teas!</p>

<p>τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι (pronounced <i>toe tee ane einai</i>). In Oxford special attention
is paid to Aristotle; and Quiller-Couch, being an Oxford man, assumes
that his readers are familiar with this phrase. It means “the essential
nature of a thing,” or, literally, “the question what a thing really is.”
Such a Society would be engaged in discovering the true meaning of Browning’s
difficult poems, so that the phrase is as appropriate as it is amusing
in its application.</p>

<p>The title “De Tea fabula” is a pun on Horace’s “Quid rides? Mutato
nomine <i>de te Fabula</i> narratur” (Sat. 1, 69). “Wherefore do you laugh?
Change but the name, of thee the tale is told.” Oxford, which Matthew
Arnold called the home of lost causes, still refuses to pronounce Latin
correctly, and makes <i>te</i> rhyme with <i>fee</i>, <i>see</i>, <i>bee</i>. It ought of course
to rhyme with <i>fay</i>, <i>say</i>, <i>bay</i>. Or possibly Sir Arthur has reverted to the
pronunciation of <i>ea</i> which prevailed until the end of the Eighteenth Century.
See Pope’s “Rape of the Lock”:</p>

threw special light upon, Browning’s <i>Pippa Passes</i>.</p>

<p>You know what a sad and sombre decorum it is that outwardly
reigns through the lands oppressed by Moslem sway. By a
strange chance in these latter days, it happened that, alone of
all the places in the land, this Bethlehem, the native village of
our Lord, escaped the moral yoke of the Mussulmans, and heard
again, after ages of dull oppression, the cheering clatter of social
freedom, and the voices of laughing girls. When I was at Bethlehem,
though long after the flight of the Mussulmans, the cloud
of Moslem propriety had not yet come back to cast its cold
shadow upon life. When you reach that gladsome village,
pray heaven there still may be heard there the voice of free innocent
girls. Distant at first, and then nearer and nearer the
timid flock will gather round you with their large burning eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>

prevent alarm, and vicious enough to avoid looking silly, the

up to your side, and touch the hem of your coat in playful defiance
of the danger; and then the rest will follow the daring of their
youthful leader, and gather close round you, and hold a shrill
controversy on the wondrous formation that you call a hat, and
the cunning of the hands that clothed you with cloth so fine;
and then, growing more profound in their researches, they will
pass from the study of your mere dress to a serious contemplation
of your stately height, and your nut-brown hair, and the ruddy
glow of your English cheeks. And if they catch a glimpse
of your ungloved fingers, then again will they make the air ring
with their sweet screams of delight and amazement, as they
compare the fairness of your hand with the hues of your sunburnt
face, or with their own warmer tints. Instantly the ringleader
of the gentle rioters imagines a new sin; with tremulous boldness
she touches, then grasps your hand, and smoothes it gently
betwixt her own, and pries curiously into its make and colour,
as though it were silk of Damascus or shawl of Cashmere. And
when they see you, even then still sage and gentle, the joyous
girls will suddenly, and screamingly, and all at once, explain
to each other that you are surely quite harmless and innocent—a
lion that makes no spring—a bear that never hugs; and upon
this faith, one after the other, they will take your passive hand,
and strive to explain it, and make it a theme and a controversy.
But the one—the fairest and the sweetest of all—is yet the most
timid; she shrinks from the daring deeds of her playmates,
and seeks shelter behind their sleeves, and strives to screen
her glowing consciousness from the eyes that look upon her.
But her laughing sisters will have none of this cowardice; they
vow that the fair one <i>shall</i> be their <i>complice</i>—<i>shall</i> share their
dangers—<i>shall</i> touch the hand of the stranger; they seize her
small wrist and draw her forward by force, and at last, whilst
yet she strives to turn away, and to cover up her whole soul under
the folds of downcast eyelids, they vanquish her utmost strength,
they vanquish her utmost modesty and marry her hand to
yours. The quick pulse springs from her fingers and throbs
like a whisper upon your listening palm. For an instant her
large timid eyes are upon you—in an instant they are shrouded
again, and there comes a blush so burning, that the frightened
girls stay their shrill laughter as though they had played too
perilously and harmed their gentle sister. A moment, and all
with a sudden intelligence turn away and fly like deer; yet soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
again like deer they wheel round, and return, and stand, and gaze
upon the danger, until they grow brave once more.</p>

<p>As regards the latter poem, the curious fact is that it is read as an exquisite
piece of <i>music</i>, and not for any poetic thought it contains. If it <i>has</i> any
coherent meaning, it is that the speaker is indifferent whether or not “her
dearest” will remember her or she will remember him. Yet the haunting
music of the lines has made it a favourite poem, and it finds a place in all
the leading anthologies. Christina Rossetti is by no means a great poet.
(Mr. Gosse’s estimate in the <i>Britannica</i> is exaggerated), but she had a wonderful

<p><i>His faith.</i>—Wallenstein, the great German soldier and statesman
(1583-1634) believed in astrology.</p>

<p>The “intelligible forms of ancient poets” and “fair humanities of
old religion” are the gods and inferior divinities that please our fancy.
Thus the Greeks peopled the heavens (not very distant heavens to them)
with their gods who visited earth and mingled with men. There were also
the lesser deities, as the Hours and the Graces; and also the Nymphs—the
Nereïds, Naiads, Orcades and Dryads—who inhabited seas, springs,
rivers, and trees respectively. The Nymphs would correspond somewhat
to the elves, gnomes and fairies of Northern religions.</p>

<p>Coleridge’s translation of “Wallenstein” (of which “The Piccolomini”
is a portion) is considered a masterpiece. Schiller was fortunate in having
a finer poet than himself to translate his drama. In the above passage
Coleridge greatly improved on the original; the seven splendid lines beginning
“The intelligible forms of ancient poets” are his and not Schiller’s;
and, therefore, this passage may fairly be ascribed to him as author.</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Molière</span> (1622-1673).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>This famous saying is quoted in French literature as though Molière
had said, “I admit plagiarism, but I so improve what I borrow from others
that it becomes my own” (see <i>Larousse</i>, under “<i>Bien</i>”).</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is, however, an interesting question whether this was the true meaning
intended by Molière.</p>

<p>The story is told by Grimarest, the first biographer of the great dramatist.
In 1671 Molière produced <i>Les Fourberies de Scapin</i>, in which he had
inserted two scenes taken from <i>Le Pedant Joué</i>, of Cyrano de Bergerac
(1619-1655). (They are the amusing scenes where Geronte repeatedly
says, <i>Que diable allait-il faire dans cette galère</i>, “What the deuce was he doing
in that Turkish galley?”) Grimarest says that Cyrano had used in these
scenes what he had overheard from Molière, and that the latter, when taxed
with the plagiarism, replied, “Je <i>reprends</i> mon bien où je le trouve” (“I
<i>take back</i> my property, wherever I find it”). That is to say, he definitely
<i>denied</i> the plagiarism.</p>

<p>Voltaire, in a “Life of Molière,” makes a general assertion (not referring
specially to this incident) that all Grimarest’s stories are false. This
must, of course, be far too sweeping an assertion, and Grimarest is in fact
quoted as an authority. Voltaire himself (1694-1778) uses the saying in
the sense given by Grimarest (<i>La Pucelle</i>, Chant III.):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Cette culotte est mienne; et je prendrai</div>
<div class="verse">Ce que fut mien où je le trouverai.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(“These breeches are mine, and I shall take what was mine wherever I
find it.”) Agnès Sorel had been captured dressed as a man and wearing
the garment in question, which had been previously stolen from the speaker.</p>

<p>It seems to me that Grimarest’s story must be accepted, that Molière
claimed the scenes as originally his and denied plagiarism. There is no
evidence to the contrary, and the saying is given its obvious meaning. (It
is word for word as in the Digest, <i>Ubi rem meam invenio, ibi vindico</i>, “Where
I find my own property, I appropriate it.”) But the question then arises,
Why should so commonplace a statement have attained such notoriety?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The explanation seems simple. Molière had many jealous and bitter
enemies, who laid every charge they could against him. He was well known
to have borrowed ideas, characters and scenes in all directions—and his
enemies constantly and persistently attacked him on this ground. Then
came his most glaring plagiarism from a comparatively recent play, written
by a man whose dare-devil exploits had made him a perfect hero of romance.
Molière’s story that Cyrano had previously stolen the scenes from him would
not been have accepted for a moment. Cyrano had never been known to
plagiarize, nor would it have been natural for a man of his character to do
anything clandestine. Also Molière would have had nothing to support his
statement—and Cyrano was not alive to contradict him. The conclusion,
therefore, seems to be that the dramatist’s statement was received in Paris
with such incredulity, indignation, and ridicule that it became a byword.</p>

<p>But if this is so, why have the words been given an entirely fictitious
meaning? The answer seems to lie in the fact that as Molière’s great
genius became realized the desire arose to remove a blemish from his
character. His is the greatest name in French literature, and almost
anything would be excused in him. (We ourselves pass lightly over plagiarisms
by Shakespeare.) Also, whether morally justified or not, Molière
enriched the world’s literature by his borrowings. It was, therefore, no
serious matter to Frenchmen that he should have borrowed from Cyrano,
but it was a distinct blemish on his character that he should have denied
the fact and also slandered a dead man. Ordinarily, in such a case, the
story is ignored and forgotten, just as the one improper act of Sir Walter
Scott, his borrowing from Coleridge of the “Christabel” metre, is usually
ignored or slurred over. But the saying had become rooted in literature
and this course was not practicable. However, there is little that enthusiasm
cannot accomplish by some means or other, and the object in this
instance has been achieved by <i>reversing the meaning</i> of Molière’s words.
If this conjecture is correct, it is an illustration of what has occurred on a
far greater scale in connection with the Greeks (see Index of Subjects).</p>

<p>As regards the meaning now given to the saying, Seneca claimed the
same right to borrow at will. <i>Quidquid bene dictum est ab ullo, meum est</i> (<i>Ep.
XVI</i>). After advising his reader to consider the Epistle carefully and see
what value it had for him, he says, “You need not be surprised if I am still
free with other people’s property. But why do I say ‘other people’s
property’? Whatever has been well said by anyone belongs to me.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>So also the late Samuel Butler said, “Appropriate things are meant
to be appropriated.”</p>

<p>In a Dublin lunatic asylum, one of the inmates peremptorily
ordered a visitor to take off his hat. Deferentially obeying
the order, the visitor asked why he should remove his hat. The
lunatic replied: “Do you not know, sir, that I am the Crown
Prince of Prussia?” Having duly made his apologies, the
visitor proceeded on his round; but, coming upon the same
lunatic, was met with the same demand. Again obeying the
order, he repeated the question: “May I ask why you wish me
to take off my hat?” The lunatic replied: “Are you not aware,
sir, that I am the Prince of Wales?” “But,” said the visitor,
“you told me just now you were the Crown Prince of Prussia.”
The lunatic, after scratching his head and deliberating for a
moment, replied: “Ah, but that was by a different mother.”</p>

he did, “Yes, but He has a rich father, and I haven’t.”</p>

<p>All attempts to define poetic imagination, to determine its scope or
prescribe its limits, leave us cold and unsatisfied, for the simple reason
that its variety and range are unlimited. The aesthetic, moral and spiritual
faculties are all in essence identical, so that no definition of the aesthetic
can exclude the spiritual, and art and poetry spring from the same root as
religion. They all have what Wordsworth calls the “Spirit of Paradise.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
Imagination<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in its larger sense includes all those higher faculties of man,
all that lifts him above his material existence. The “True Romance”
in this fine poem is imagination in this complete sense. By our lower
perceptive faculties we see the world of Nature in its material form; by
our higher powers we apprehend its aesthetic, moral and spiritual beauty.
(Man with his consciousness, will, reason, and also his higher imaginative
faculties, is as much part of <i>Nature</i> as any star or clod, crystal or gas,
fly or flower.) Hence imagination gives us the vision of glory in earth and
sky, the sense of wonder and worship, the emotions of sympathy and love;
it teaches us duty and self sacrifice; it awakens in us a sense of the
mystery of birth, life and death, directing our thoughts from the finite and
material world to the infinite realm of the spiritual.</p>

<p><i>Verse 4, lines 5, 6.</i> Our faculties develop, and we realize, for example,
the beauty of Nature which was not apparent to the Greeks of Plato’s
time (<a href="#Page_379">see p. 379</a>; <a href="#Page_283">see also p. 283</a>). <i>Verse 9, l. 5, 6.</i> Imagination teaches
us heroism. In the italicized verses, “our war” is, of course, the strife
of our material existence: we can face with courage the mischances of life,
seeing that “My Lady Romance,” the soul which is our higher nature,
must persist through life and after death. (“<i>Barrière</i>,” barrier.)</p>

<p>They who believe in the influences of the stars over the fates
of men are, in feeling at least, nearer the truth than they who
regard the heavenly bodies as related to them merely by a common
obedience to an external law. All that man sees has to do
with man. Worlds cannot be without an intermundane relationship.
The community of the centre of all creation suggests an
inter-radiating connection and dependence of the parts. Else
a grander idea is conceivable than that which is already embodied.
The blank, which is only a forgotten life lying behind the consciousness,
and the misty splendour, which is an undeveloped
life lying before it, may be full of mysterious revelations of other
connections with the worlds around us than those of science and
poetry. No shining belt or gleaming moon, no red and green
glory in a self-encircling twin-star, but has a relation with the
hidden things of a man’s soul, and, it may be, with the secret
history of his body as well. They are portions of the living house
within which he abides.</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>This is the first of the chain of sonnets, which Mrs. Browning called
“Sonnets from the Portuguese.” They tell her own love-story, and were
written in secret and without thought of publication. Robert Browning
learnt of them only the year after the marriage, and then insisted on their
being published. They include some of the finest sonnets in our language.</p>

<p>To appreciate this and the other sonnets, it is necessary to know
the beautiful story of the two poets. Mrs. Browning was six years older
than her husband and a life-long invalid, expecting, as she says in this
sonnet, Death rather than Love. Their marriage was supremely happy,
and the great poet, when in England, used to visit the church in which they
were married to express his thankfulness. He tells the love-story in the
next quotation.</p>

<p>In these sonnets Mrs. Browning laid bare her innermost feelings.</p>

<p>Robert Browning, however, in several poems says the privacy of a
poet’s life and feelings should not be bared to the public. Wordsworth
had written in 1827:</p>

<p>The last verse, describing Mrs. Browning, makes it clear that the poet
is speaking of his own love-story, although the scene is imaginary. The
last two verses are to be read literally, as an expression of the poet’s firm
belief, and not as poetical exaggeration.</p>

<p>You must not say that this cannot be, or that that is contrary
to nature. You do not know what Nature is, or what she can do;
and nobody knows. Wise men are afraid to say that there is
anything contrary to nature, except what is contrary to mathematical
truth, as that two and two cannot make five. There
are dozens and hundreds of things in the world which we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
certainly have said were contrary to nature, if we did not see
them going on under our eyes all day long. If people had never
seen little seeds grow into great plants and trees, of quite different
shapes from themselves, and these trees again produce fresh seeds,
they would have said, “The thing cannot be”.... Suppose
that no human being had ever seen or heard of an elephant.
And suppose that you described him to people, and said, “This
is the shape, and plan, and anatomy of the beast ... and this
is the section of his skull, more like a mushroom than a reasonable
skull of a reasonable or unreasonable beast; yet he is the wisest
of all beasts, and can do everything save read, write, and cast
accounts.” People would surely have said, “Nonsense; your
elephant is contrary to nature,” and have thought you were
telling stories—as the French thought of Le Vaillant when he came
back to Paris and said that he had shot a giraffe; and as the
King of the Cannibal Islands thought of the English sailor, when
he said that in his country water turned to marble, and rain fell
as feathers. The truth is that folks’ fancy that such and such
things cannot be, simply because they have not seen them,
is worth no more than a savage’s fancy that there cannot be
such a thing as a locomotive, because he never saw one running
wild in the forest.</p>

<p>This passage interested us greatly in the old days, and also another
passage drawing a not very satisfactory analogy between the transformation
of insects and our probable transformation at death. I do not know
whether the elephant’s brain warrants Kingsley’s deduction.</p>

<p>This book, published in 1863,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> had a considerable effect in doing away
with the barbarous employment of young children in mines, factories,
brickfields, etc. It called attention particularly to the chimney-sweep
boys of four or five years of age who had to climb up the narrow chimneys,
and who were simply slaves, neglected and ill-treated by their drunken
masters. We are apt to forget how recently we emerged from barbarism
in many directions, and that we are only now becoming civilized in other
respects, as, for instance, with regard to the poor, suffering, and ignorant.</p>

<p>Wars seem to leave little trace except where they result in the immigration
and settlement of a tribe or nation. Otherwise they appear to cancel
one another. The present war will probably destroy the only trace of the

<p>A century ago men were following, with bated breath, the
march of Napoleon, and waiting with feverish impatience for the
latest news of the wars. And all the while, in their own homes,
babies were being born. But who could think about <i>babies</i>? Everybody
was thinking about <i>battles</i>. In one year, lying midway
between Trafalgar and Waterloo, there stole into the world
a host of heroes! During that one year, 1809, Mr. Gladstone was
born in Liverpool; Alfred Tennyson was born at the Somersby
rectory and Oliver Wendell Holmes made his first appearance
in Massachusetts. On the very self-same day of that
self-same year Charles Darwin made his debut at Shrewsbury,
and Abraham Lincoln drew his first breath in old Kentucky.
Music was enriched by the advent of Frederic Chopin at Warsaw,
and of Felix Mendelssohn at Hamburg. Within the same year,
too, Samuel Morley was born in Homerton, Edward Fitzgerald
in Woodbridge, Elizabeth Barrett Browning in Durham, and
Frances Kemble in London. But nobody thought of babies.
Everybody was thinking of battles. Yet, viewing that age in the
truer perspective which the distance of a hundred years enables
us to command, we may well ask ourselves, “Which of the battles
of 1809 mattered more than the babies of 1809?” ...</p>

<p>We fancy that God can only manage His world by big battalions
abroad, when all the while He is doing it by beautiful
babies at home. When a wrong wants righting, or a truth wants
preaching, or a continent wants opening, God sends a baby into
the world to do it. That is why, long, long ago, a babe was born
in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Continuing the work of creation, <i>i.e.</i>, co-operating as instruments
of Providence in bringing order out of disorder ... is
only a part of the mission of mankind, and the time will come
again when its due rank will be assigned to contemplation and
the calm culture of reverence and love. Then poetry will resume
her equality with prose.... But that time is not yet, and the
crowning glory of Wordsworth is that he has borne witness to
it and kept alive its traditions in an age, which, but for him,
would have lost sight of it entirely.</p>

<p>In that utilitarian period the figure of the great poet stands out in sheer
sublimity. Apart from the depressing atmosphere of the time, one needs
to remember how serenely he continued to deliver his high message in

£10 from his poems and nothing more until he was sixty-five! The

love has left it. His starved affections will no longer accept
stone, though pulverized flour-like and artfully kneaded, for

climbs to beauty, and the lost bowers of childhood’s trust may
be found again.</p>

<p>The “Dark Companion” is no doubt the star known as the “Companion
of Sirius.” Certain peculiarities in the motion of Sirius led Bessel
in 1844 to the belief that it had an obscure companion, with which it was
in revolution. The position of the companion having been ascertained
by calculation, it was at last found in 1862. It is equal in mass to our sun
but is obscured by the brilliancy of Sirius, which is the brightest of the fixed
stars. Brunton Stephens’ poem was published in Melbourne in 1873.</p>

<p>I think, I said, I can make it plain that there are at least
six personalities distinctly to be recognized as taking part in a
dialogue between John and Thomas.</p>

<p class="hanging">Three Johns: The real John—known only to his Maker.
John’s ideal John—never the real one, and often very
unlike him. Thomas’s ideal John—never the real John,
nor John’s John, but often very unlike either.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">Three Thomases: The real Thomas. Thomas’s ideal Thomas.
John’s ideal Thomas.</p>

<p>Only one of the three Johns is taxed; only one can be weighed
on a platform balance; but the other two are just as important
in the conversation. Let us suppose the real John to be old,
dull, and ill-looking. But as the Higher Powers have not conferred
on men the gift of seeing themselves in the true light,
John very possibly conceives himself to be youthful, witty,
and fascinating, and talks from the point of view of this ideal.
Thomas, again, believes him to be an artful rogue, we will say;
therefore he <i>is</i>, so far as Thomas’s attitude in the conversation
is concerned, an artful rogue, though really simple and stupid.
The same conditions apply to the three Thomases. It follows
that, until a man can be found who knows himself as his Maker
knows him, or who sees himself as others see him, there must be
at least six persons engaged in every dialogue between two.
Of these the least important, philosophically speaking, is the one
that we have called the real person. No wonder two disputants
often get angry, when there are six of them talking and listening
all at the same time.</p>

<p>(A very unphilosophical application of the above remarks
was made by a young fellow, answering to the name of John,
who sits near me at table. A certain basket of peaches, a rare
vegetable little known to boarding-houses, was on its way to me
<i>via</i> this unlettered Johannes. He appropriated the three that
remained in the basket, remarking that there was just one
apiece for him. I convinced him that his practical inference
was hasty and illogical, but in the meantime he had eaten the
peaches.)</p>

<p>In this fine poem there are <i>puns</i>. In the last verse one pun is on the
words “Son” and “Sun,” Christ being the “Sun of righteousness who
arises with healing in his wings” (<i>Malachi</i> iv, 2). Also in the fifth, eleventh, and
seventeenth lines, the play is on the last word “done” and the poet’s name
Donne, which was pronounced <i>dun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> (It was occasionally written Dun, Dunne,
or Done: see Grierson’s <i>Poems of John Donne</i>, Vol. II, pp. lvii, lxxvii,
lxxxvii, 8 and 12. Contrariwise, the adjective “dun,” dull-brown,
was spelt <i>donne</i> in the poet’s time.) We are accustomed only to the jocular
use of puns, but here there is a serious intention to give two meanings to
one expression. Such a use of puns was one of the “quaint conceits”
of that period of our literature, and it is found also in serious Persian poetry.</p>

<p>(Darwin’s <i>Origin of Species</i> was published in November, 1859.)
At the Oxford meeting of the British Association in 1860 Huxley
had on Thursday, June 28, directly contradicted Professor
Owen’s statement that a gorilla’s brain differed more from a
man’s than it did from the brain of the lowest of the Quadrumana
(apes, monkeys, and lemurs). He was thus marked out as the
champion of evolution. On the Saturday, although the public
were not admitted, the members crowded the room to suffocation,
anxious to hear the brilliant controversialist, Bishop Wilberforce,
take part in the debate. An unimportant paper was read
bearing upon Darwinism, and a discussion followed. The Bishop,
inspired by Owen, began his speech. He spoke in dulcet tones,
persuasive manner, and with well-turned periods, but ridiculing
Darwin badly and Huxley savagely. “In a light, scoffing
tone, florid and fluent, he assured us there was nothing in the
idea of evolution: rock-pigeons were what rock-pigeons had
always been. Then, turning to Huxley, with a smiling insolence,
he begged to know, <i>was it through his grandfather or his grandmother
that he claimed his descent from a monkey</i>.”</p>

<p>As he said this, Huxley turned to his neighbour and said,
“The Lord hath delivered him into mine hands!” On rising
to speak, he first gave a forcible and eloquent reply to the scientific
part of the Bishop’s argument. Then “he stood before us and
spoke those tremendous words—words, which no one seems sure
of now, nor, I think, could remember just after they were spoken,
for their meaning took away our breath, though it left us in no
doubt as to what it was. “He was not ashamed to have a monkey
for his ancestor: but he would be ashamed to be connected
with a man who used great gifts to obscure the truth.” No one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
doubted his meaning, and the effect was tremendous. One
lady fainted and had to be carried out; I, for one, jumped out
of my seat.” (<i>Macmillan’s</i>, 1898.) There is no verbatim
report of this incident, but the varying accounts agree in outline.</p>

<p class="attribution">(<i>Extracted from Life of Huxley.</i>)</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>One object of this book is to bring back the memories of the seventy-eighties—and
of overwhelming interest at the time was the alleged conflict
between religion and science. Through Darwin’s great discovery and
Herbert Spencer’s world-wide extension of the evolution theory, so much
was found covered by law that men were blinded to the fact that the essential
question of causality, lying behind all law, was still untouched.</p>

<p>The important and thrilling incident referred to above took place
in 1860, when I was two years old, but it was still an absorbing topic thirteen
or fourteen years later, and is one of my most vivid recollections.</p>

<p>Wilberforce (1805-1873) was a great Churchman and, indeed, has
been said to be the greatest prelate of his age, although his nickname
“Soapy Sam” led to a popular depreciation of his merits. (This epithet
originally meant that he was evasive on certain questions, but it took a
further meaning from his persuasive eloquence.) In this instance he meddled
with a subject of which he was ignorant. Owen, who instigated him to
make this attack on Darwin and Huxley had at first welcomed the theory
of evolution, but quailed before the orthodox indignation against the necessary
extension of that theory to the origin of man. Huxley (1825-1895)
was thirty-five years of age when he thus showed himself a strong debater
and a power in the scientific world.</p>

<p>On tracing the line of life backwards, we see it approaching
more and more to what we call the purely physical condition.
We come at length to those organisms which I have compared
to drops of oil suspended in a mixture of alcohol and water. We
reach the <i>protogenes</i> of Haeckel, in which we have “a type
distinguishable from a fragment of albumen only by its finely
granular character.” Can we pause here? We break a magnet
and find two poles in each of its fragments. We continue the
process of breaking; but however small the parts, each carries
with it, though enfeebled, the polarity of the whole. And when
we can break no longer, we prolong the intellectual vision to the
polar molecules. Are we not urged to do <i>something</i> similar
in the case of life?... Believing, as I do, in the continuity of
nature, I cannot stop abruptly where our microscopes cease to
be of use. Here the vision of the mind authoritatively supplements
the vision of the eye. By a necessity engendered and
justified by science I cross the boundary of the experimental
evidence, and <i>discern in that Matter</i> which we, in our ignorance
of its latent powers, and notwithstanding our professed reverence
for its Creator, have hitherto covered with opprobrium, <i>the
promise and potency of all terrestrial Life</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>(Referring to the question of inquiring into the mystery
of our origin). Here, however, I touch a theme too great for me
to handle, but which will assuredly be handled by the loftiest
minds, <i>when you and I, like streaks of morning cloud, shall have
melted into the infinite azure of the past</i>.</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">John Tyndall.</span></p>

<div class="notes">

<p>The italics are mine.</p>

<p>As in the preceding quotation the subject is the alleged conflict between
religion and science, which occupied so large a space in our life and thought
in the seventies and eighties. The above are the two passages from Tyndall’s
presidential address at the Belfast meeting of the British Association
in 1874, which caused an immense sensation. The Belfast Address, like
Huxley’s smashing reply to Bishop Wilberforce, was useful in showing
that all scientific questions must be considered with an open mind, free of
theological bias, and also in adding testimony to the importance and value
of Darwin’s investigation. Although fifteen years had passed since <i>The
Origin of Species</i> was published, this was still necessary. (At that very
time Professor McCoy, afterwards Sir Frederick McCoy, F.R.S., when
lecturing at the Melbourne University to his students, of whom I was one,
was still making inane jokes about evolution and our monkey cousins.)</p>

<p>But, while the world was in ferment over the question of man’s alleged
kinship with the monkey, there came the further startling fact that the
President of the British Association also proclaimed his belief in <i>materialism</i>
and, inferentially, that there was no life after death. Englishmen had not
before realized how widely materialism had spread through England and
Europe. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that a <i>majority</i> at least
of the leading thinkers had become materialists.</p>

<p>In travelling outside science into metaphysics, Tyndall betrayed
a lamentable ignorance of the latter—a parallel case to that of Bishop
Wilberforce when he attempted to meddle with science. Martineau,
referring to the first quotation above, wrote: “There is no magic in the
superlatively little to draw from the universe its last secret. Size is but
relative, magnified or dwindled by a glass, variable with the organ of perception:
to one being, the speck which only the microscope can show us
may be a universe; to another, the solar system but a molecule; and in
the passing from the latter to the former you reach no end of search or
beginning of things. You merely substitute a miniature of nature for its
life-size without at all showing whence the features arise.”</p>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Archibald Henry Sayce</span> (<i>Academy, Dec. 5, 1885</i>).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="notes">

<p>As in the two preceding quotations, the subject is the supposed conflict
of religion and science. Haeckel (born 1834, recently dead) was the most
ruthless of all the biologists in accounting for evolution and all progress by
a struggle for existence. Renan (1823-1892), the French writer, whose love
of Christianity survived his belief in it, speaks of the passing away of the
old faith as “the golden glory of the dying day,” and says that in its death
it will be more beautiful than in its life, when it led to passion, persecution
and war. The penultimate verse refers to the time when temporal power
was removed from the church, and she reverted to the humility, and also the
beauty, of primitive Christianity when it came in its morning glory from the
East.</p>

<p>The fact that these fine verses are by the great philologist and archæologist,
Professor Sayce, who has not publicly appeared in the rôle of a poet,
adds greatly to their interest. The few verses he has published have mostly
appeared over the initials “A.H.S.” in the old <i>Academy</i> (the present
periodical is a different concern), and he was not known to the public
as the author.</p>

<p>Anything about Professor Sayce must be interesting to the reader,
and I, therefore, need not apologize for mentioning the following incidents,
which, I imagine, are known only among his friends. In 1870, during the
Franco-German War, Mr. Sayce was ordered to be shot at Nantes as a
German spy, and only escaped “by the skin of his teeth.” It was just before
Gambetta had flown in his balloon out of Paris, and there was no recognized
Government in the country. Nantes was full of fugitives, and bands of
Uhlans were in the neighbourhood. Mr. Sayce was arrested when walking
round the old citadel examining its walls—not realizing that it was occupied
by French troops. Fortunately, some ladies of the garrison came in during
his examination to see the interesting young prisoner and, after Mr. Sayce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
had been placed against the wall and a soldier told off to shoot him, they
prevailed upon the Commandant to give him a second examination, which
ended in his acquittal.</p>

<p>Mr. Sayce was also among the Carlists in the Carlist war of 1873, and was
present at some of the so-called battles which, he says, were dangerous
only to the onlookers. He also once had a pitched battle with Bedouins
in Syria.</p>

<p>Professor Sayce (he became Professor in 1876) has also the proud
distinction of being the only person known to have survived the bite of the
Egyptian cerastes asp, which is supposed to have killed Cleopatra. He
accidentally trod on the reptile in the desert some three or four miles north
of Assouan and was bitten in the leg. Luckily, he happened to be just
outside the dahabieh in which he was travelling with three Oxford friends,
one of them the late Master of Balliol. The cook had a small pair of red-hot
tongs, with which he had been preparing lunch, and Professor Sayce
was able to burn the bitten leg down to the bone within two minutes after
the accident; thus saving his life at the expense of a few weeks’ lameness.</p>

<p>A young handsome priest, who had led a gay life, was moved by pure
motives to rescue a beautiful young wife from a dreadful husband, and he
travelled with her for three days to Rome. The husband was following
with an armed band, the priest was risking disgrace, and the girl was risking
death. The mutual danger would in itself tend to draw the fugitives
too closely together; but also the girl had shown herself doubly lovable,
for the strain and stress had revealed in her a very beautiful nature—just

<p>Coleridge has a similar illustration, “Quarrels of anger ending in tears
are favourable to love in its spring tide, as plants are found to grow very
rapidly after a thunderstorm with rain”—(Allsop’s <i>Letters, etc., of Coleridge</i>).
Coleridge died in 1834, and “The Ring and the Book” was published
in 1868-9: it is curious that both poets should have been impressed with a
fact that appears to have been only recently recognized. In the seventies
Lemström proved that plants thrive under electricity; but I think it is only
a few years ago that in some agricultural experiments in Germany it was
found that electricity was of no benefit to the crops <i>without rain or other
moisture</i>.</p>

<p>A loose, slack, not well-dressed youth met Mr. Green and
myself in a lane near Highgate. Green knew him and spoke. It
was Keats. He was introduced to me, and stayed a minute or so.
After he had left us a little way, he came back and said, “Let
me carry away the memory, Coleridge, of having pressed your
hand!” “There is death in that hand,” I said to Green, when
Keats was gone; yet this was, I believe, before the consumption
showed itself distinctly.</p>

<p>In philosophy equally as in poetry it is the highest and most
useful prerogative of genius to produce the strongest impressions
of novelty, while it rescues admitted truths from the neglect
caused by the very circumstances of their universal admission.
Extremes meet. Truths, of all others the most awful and
interesting, are too often considered as so true, that they lose all
the power of truth, and lie bed-ridden in the dormitory of the
soul, side by side with the most despised and exploded errors.</p>

<p>The Baptist might be in the Wilderness shouting to the poor,
who were listening with all their might and faith to the preacher’s
awful accents and denunciations of wrath or woe or salvation;
and our friend the Sadducee would turn his sleek mule with a shrug
and a smile from the crowd, and go home to the shade of his
terrace, and muse, over preacher and audience, and turn to his
roll of Plato, or his pleasant Greek song-book babbling of honey
and Hybla, and nymphs and fountains and love. To what,
we say, does this scepticism lead? It leads a man to a shameful
loneliness and selfishness, so to speak—the more shameful,
because it is so good-humoured and conscienceless and serene.
Conscience! What is conscience? Why accept remorse? What
is public or private faith? Myths alike enveloped in enormous
tradition. If seeing and acknowledging the lies of the world,
Arthur, as see them you can with only too fatal a clearness,
you submit to them without any protest farther than a laugh:
if, plunged yourself in easy sensuality, you allow the whole
wretched world to pass groaning by you unmoved: if the fight
for the truth is taking place, and all men of honour are on the
ground armed on the one side or the other, and you alone are to
lie on your balcony and smoke your pipe out of the noise and
the danger, you had better have died, or never have been at
all, than such a sensual coward.</p>

<p>What a monstrous spectre is this man, the disease of the
agglutinated dust, lifting alternate feet or lying drugged with
slumber; killing, feeding, growing, bringing forth small copies
of himself; grown upon with hair like grass, fitted with eyes
that move and glitter in his face; a thing to set children screaming;—and
yet looked at nearlier, known as his fellows know him,
how surprising are his attributes! Poor soul, here for so little,
cast among so many hardships, filled with desires so incommensurate
and so inconsistent, savagely surrounded, savagely
descended, irremediably condemned to prey upon his fellow
lives: who should have blamed him had he been of a piece with
his destiny and a being merely barbarous? And we look and
behold him instead filled with imperfect virtues: infinitely
childish, often admirably valiant, often touchingly kind; sitting
down, amidst his momentary life, to debate of right and wrong
and the attributes of the deity; rising up to do battle for an egg or
die for an idea; singling out his friends and his mate with cordial
affection; bringing forth in pain, rearing with long-suffering
solicitude, his young. To touch the heart of his mystery, we find
in him one thought, strange to the point of lunacy: the thought
of duty; the thought of something owing to himself, to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
neighbour, to his God; an ideal of decency, to which he would
rise if it were possible; a limit of shame, below which, if it be
possible, he will not stoop.</p>

<p>Human nature, trained in the School of Christianity, throws
away as false the delineation of piety in the disguise of Hebe,
and declares that there is something higher than happiness—that
thought which is ever full of care and truth is better far—that
all true and disinterested affection, which often is called
to mourn, is better still—that the devoted allegiance of conscience
to duty and to God—which ever has in it more of penitence than
of joy—is noblest of all.</p>

<p>There is in man a <i>Higher</i> than Love of Happiness; he can do
without Happiness, and instead thereof find Blessedness! Was
it not to preach forth this same <i>Higher</i> that sages and martyrs,
the poet and the priest, in all times have spoken and suffered;
bearing testimony, through life and through death, of the Godlike
that is in Man, and how in the Godlike only has he Strength
and Freedom? Which God-inspired Doctrine art thou also
honoured to be taught; O Heavens! and broken with manifold
merciful Afflictions, even till thou become contrite and learn it!
O thank thy Destiny for these; thankfully bear what yet remain;
thou hadst need of them; the Self in thee needed to be annihilated....
Love not Pleasure; love God. This is the EVERLASTING
YEA, wherein all contradiction is solved; wherein whoso walks
and works, it is well with him.... To the <i>Worship of Sorrow</i>,
ascribe what origin and genesis thou pleasest, has not that
Worship originated, and been generated? Is it not <i>here</i>?
Feel it in thy heart, and then say whether it is of God! This is
Belief; all else is Opinion.... Do the Duty which liest nearest
thee, which thou knowest to be a Duty. The Situation that
has not its Duty, its Ideal, was never yet occupied by man. Yes
here, in this poor, miserable, hampered, despicable Actual, wherein
thou even now standest, here or nowhere is thy Ideal: work
it out therefrom; and working, believe, live, be free. The Ideal
is in thyself.</p>

<p>The belief that the sense of duty and moral aspiration arise from
within ourselves, and are the cause rather than the result of sociological
evolution is far more widespread to-day than in what Carlyle calls his
“atheistical century.” The “Everlasting Yea” is opposed to the “Everlasting
No” of nescience.</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Is Praxinoë at home?</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> My dear Gorgo, at last! Yes, here I am. Euno,
find a chair—get a cushion for it.</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> It will do beautifully as it is.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> Do sit down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Oh, this gad-about spirit! I could hardly get to you,
Praxinoë, through all the crowd and all the carriages. Nothing
but heavy boots, nothing but men in uniform. And what
a journey it is! My dear child, you really live <i>too</i> far off.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> It is all that insane husband of mine. He has
chosen to come out here to the end of the world, and take a hole
of a place—for a house it is not—on purpose that you and I
might not be neighbours. He is always just the same—anything
to quarrel with one! anything for spite!</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> My dear, don’t talk so of your husband before the
little fellow. Just see how astonished he looks at you. (<i>Talking
to the child.</i>) Never mind, Zopyrio my pet, she is not talking
about papa. (Good heavens, the child does really understand.)
Pretty papa!</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> That “pretty papa” of his the other day (though
I told him beforehand to mind what he was about), when I sent
him to a shop to buy soap and rouge, brought me home salt
instead; stupid, great, big, interminable animal!</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Mine is just the fellow to him. But never mind now,
get on your things and let us be off to the palace to see the Adonis.
I hear the Queen’s decorations are something splendid.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> “In grand people’s houses everything is grand.”
What things you have seen in Alexandria! What a deal you will
have to tell to anybody who has never been there!</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Come, we ought to be going.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> “Every day is a holiday to people who have nothing
to do.” Eunoë, pick up your work; and take care, you lazy
girl, how you leave it lying about again; the cats find it just
the bed they like. Come, stir yourself, fetch me some water,
quick! I wanted the water first, and the girl brings me the soap.
Never mind; give it me. Not all that, extravagant! Now
pour out the water—stupid! Why don’t you take care of my
dress? That will do. I have got my hands washed as it pleased
God. Where is the key of the large wardrobe? Bring it here—quick!</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Praxinoë, you can’t think how well that dress, made
full, as you have got it, suits you. Tell me, how much did
it cost—the dress by itself, I mean?</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> Don’t talk of it, Gorgo: more than eight guineas
of good hard money. And about the work on it, I have almost
worn my life out.</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Well, you couldn’t have done better.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> Thank you. Bring me my shawl, and put my
hat properly on my head—<i>properly</i>. No, child (<i>to her little
boy</i>,) I am not going to take you; there’s a bogey on horseback<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
who bites. Cry as much as you like; I’m not going to have you
lamed for life. Now we’ll start. Nurse take the little one and
amuse him; call the dog in, and shut the street door. (<i>They
go out.</i>) Good heavens! what a crowd of people! How on earth
are we ever to get through all this? They are like ants: you
can’t count them. My dearest Gorgo, what will become of us?
Here are the Royal Horse Guards. My good man, don’t ride
over me! Look at that bay horse rearing bolt upright; what
a vicious one! Eunoë, you mad girl, do take care!—that horse
will certainly be the death of the man on his back. How glad
I am now, that I left the child safe at home.</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> All right, Praxinoë, we are safe behind them; and they
have gone on to where they are stationed.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> Well, yes, I begin to revive again. From the time
I was a little girl I have had more horror of horses and snakes
than of anything else in the world. Let us get on; here’s a great
crowd coming this way upon us.</p>

<p><i>Gorgo</i> (<i>to an old woman</i>). Mother, are you from the palace?</p>

<p><i>Old woman.</i> Yes, my dears.</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Has one a tolerable chance of getting there?</p>

<p><i>Old woman.</i> My pretty young lady, the Greeks got to Troy
by dint of trying hard; trying will do anything in this world.</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> The old creature has delivered an oracle and disappeared.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> Women can tell you everything about everything,
even about Jupiter’s marriage with Juno!</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Look, Praxinoë, what a squeeze at the palace gates.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> Tremendous! Take hold of me, Gorgo; and you,
Eunoë, take hold of Eutychis!—tight hold, or you’ll be lost.
Here we go in all together. Hold tight to us, Eunoë! Oh, dear!
oh, dear! Gorgo, there’s my scarf torn right in two. For
heaven’s sake, my good man, as you hope to be saved, take care
of my dress!</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> I’ll do what I can, but it doesn’t depend upon me.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> What heaps of people! They push like a drove
of pigs.</p>

<p><i>Stranger.</i> Don’t be frightened, ma’am, we are all right.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> May you be all right, my dear sir, to the last day
you live, for the care you have taken of us! What a kind,
considerate man! There is Eunoë jammed in a squeeze. Push,
you goose, push! Capital! We are all of us the right side
of the door, as the bridegroom said when he had locked himself
in with the bride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Praxinoë, come this way. Do but look at that work,
how delicate it is!—how exquisite! Why, the gods might wear
it in heaven.</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> Goddess of Spinning, what hands were hired to
do that work? Who designed those beautiful patterns? They
seem to stand up and move about, as if they were real—as if
they were living things, and not needlework. Well, man is a
wonderful creature! And look, look, how charming <i>he</i> lies
there on his silver couch, with just a soft down on his cheeks,
that beloved Adonis—Adonis, whom one loves even though he
is dead!</p>

<p><i>Another stranger.</i> You wretched women, do stop your incessant
chatter! Like turtles, you go on for ever.</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Lord, where does the man come from? What is it
to you if we <i>are</i> chatterboxes? Order about your own servants!</p>

<p><i>Praxinoë.</i> Oh, honey-sweet Proserpine, let us have no more
masters than the one we’ve got! We don’t the least care for
<i>you</i>; pray don’t trouble yourself for nothing.</p>

<p><i>Gorgo.</i> Be quiet, Praxinoë! That first-rate singer, the
Argive woman’s daughter, is going to sing the <i>Adonis</i> hymn.
She is the same who was chosen to sing the dirge last year. We are
sure to have something first-rate from <i>her</i>. She is going through
her airs and graces ready to begin.</p>

no doubt be slave-girls.</p>

<p>Some curious facts may be noted. The wife is kept in seclusion and
the husband does the marketing, buying among other things her <i>rouge</i>.
Observe how perfunctory are the pretty lady’s ablutions (the soap, by the
way, is in the form of paste). The little boy represents the ruling sex
and will be removed at an early age from her control. She is disposed
to rebel against her lord and master, but takes the utmost care of the
important boy-child. While the ladies with their slaves make up their
own dresses, the designs and the finest needlework are done by men. The
Greek woman in Athens was practically uneducated and regarded as an
inferior being; but these ladies were Dorian Greeks and would no doubt
be better treated and have somewhat more freedom—especially in Alexandria,
which was a colony and, therefore, probably less conservative.
Although no doubt veiled, their eyes would be visible and, as seen in the
East to-day, a pretty woman can always manage to show her beauty, if
she chooses. It will be seen that one man is polite to the two young,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
pretty, richly-dressed ladies, and saves them from being crushed by the
crowd, while another is a crusty, grumpy person, who treats them with
some rudeness and, in the original, ridicules their Dorian pronunciation.
Praxinoë is most grateful to the polite man for what would now be an
ordinary act of courtesy.</p>

<p>As regards the conversation Andrew Lang says: “Nothing can be
more gay and natural than the chatter of the women, which has changed
no more in two thousand years than the song of birds.”</p>

<p>I am especially pleased with their <i>freundin</i> (the German word
meaning a female friend), which unlike the <i>amica</i> of the Romans,
is seldom used but in its best and purest sense. Now I know
it will be said that a friend is already something more than
a friend, when a man feels an anxiety to express to himself
that this friend is a female; but this I deny—in that sense at least
in which the objection will be made. I would hazard the impeachment
of heresy, rather than abandon my belief that there is a
sex in our souls as well as in their perishable garments; and he
who does not feel it, never truly loved a sister—nay, is not capable
even of loving a wife as she deserves to be loved, if she indeed be
worthy of that holy name.</p>

Can it be true what is so constantly affirmed, that there is no sex in souls?—I
doubt it, I doubt it exceedingly.”—<i>Table Talk.</i></p>

<p>But surely Coleridge might have found the best proof of his contention
in the nature of children, the small boy who fights with his fists, plays with
tin soldiers and despises “girls,” and the girl-child who loves her doll and
her pretty clothes. See next quotation.</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>Francis Thompson is one of the “difficult” poets who repay study.
Here he says that, in the young girl, sex appears in a less complex form
than in the woman and, just as Perseus could safely look at the reflection
on his shield of the fatal Medusa’s head, so we can freely view womanhood
in the girl-child. Nothing conceals her open, innocent, feminine nature.
She is the Dryad, the Nymph who lives in the tree and is born and dies
with it, but is as yet unconscious of the tree, that is, of her sex. Her
“young sex is yet but in her soul,” and is like the juice of the grape which
has not yet fermented into wine, or the calm air which sleeps undisturbed.
The mystery of womanhood, which attracts and yet, in its own protection,
repulses man, will not come to her until after the changes of years. It is
the Aphrodite lying in unawakened beauty before she rises as a goddess
from the sea. (“Facilely” appears to have the strained meaning “easy
to understand” or “simply”; the word “gated,” “confined,” is a curious
use of a university word: the Oxford or Cambridge undergraduate, who has
misbehaved, may be “gated” for a period, <i>i.e.</i>, confined to the precincts
of his own college.) “The dragon to its own Hesperides”—the Hesperides
were maidens who guarded the golden apples of love and fruitfulness, which
Earth had given to Hera on her marriage to Zeus. The maidens were
protected by a dragon. Here the dragon is the maiden’s own sensitive
reserve and self-protecting nature, which enable her to protect herself.
(“Conchèd,” Aphrodite is lying in her shell.)</p>

<p>Compare the ancient with the modern world; “Look on this
picture, and on that.” One broad distinction in the characters
of men forces itself into prominence. Among all the men of the
ancient heathen world there were scarcely one or two to whom
we might venture to apply the epithet “holy.” In other words,
there were not more than one or two, if any, who besides being
virtuous in their actions were possessed with an unaffected enthusiasm
of goodness, and besides abstaining from vice regarded
even a vicious thought with horror. Probably no one will
deny that in Christian countries this higher-toned goodness,
which we call holiness, has existed. Few will maintain that it
has been exceedingly rare. Perhaps the truth is, that there has
scarcely been a town in any Christian country since the time
of Christ where a century has passed without exhibiting a character
of such elevation that his mere presence has shamed the bad
and made the good better, and has been felt at times like the
presence of God Himself. And if this be so, has Christ failed?
or can Christianity die?</p>

<p>As psychology comprises all our sensibilities, pleasures,

to have a special nobility and greatness, and a special power
of evoking in the student the feelings themselves. The mathematician,
dealing with conic sections, spirals, and differential
equations, is in danger of being ultimately resolved into a function

must become conscientious; driving fat oxen is the way to grow

<p>There is a crude absurd materialism abroad which hasn’t
yet learned the fundamental difference between Mind and Matter.
It is altogether incomprehensible how any material processes
can beget sensations and feelings and thoughts; it is altogether
incomprehensible how <i>you</i> arose or <i>I</i> arose. Listen to Spencer:—“Were
we compelled to choose between the alternatives of translating
mental phenomena into physical phenomena, or of translating
physical phenomena into mental phenomena, the latter
alternative would seem the more preferable of the two.... Hence
though of the two it seems easier to translate so-called Matter
into so-called Spirit, than to translate so-called Spirit into so-called
Matter (which latter is, indeed, wholly impossible), yet no
translation can carry us beyond our symbols.”</p>

<p class="center">WHAT IS LOVE?</p>

<p>The passion which unites the sexes ... is the most compound,
and therefore the most powerful of all the feelings. Added
to the purely physical elements of it are, first, those highly
complex impressions produced by personal beauty.... With
this there is united the complex sentiment which we term affection—a
sentiment which, as it can exist between those of the same
sex, must be regarded as an independent sentiment.... Then
there is the sentiment of admiration, respect, or reverence.... There
comes next the feeling called love of approbation. To
be preferred above all the world, and that by one admired above
all others, is to have the love of approbation gratified in a degree
passing every previous experience.... Further, the allied
emotion of self-esteem comes into play. To have succeeded in
gaining such attachment from, and sway over, another is a
proof of power which cannot fail agreeably to excite the <i>amour
propre</i>. Yet again, the proprietary feeling has its share in the
general activity: there is the pleasure of possession—the two
belong to each other. Once more, the relation allows of an
extended liberty of action. Towards other persons a restrained
behaviour is requisite. Round each there is a subtle boundary
that may not be crossed—an individuality on which none may
trespass. But in this case the barriers are thrown down; and thus
the love of unrestrained activity is gratified. Finally there is an
exaltation of the sympathies. Egoistic pleasures of all kinds
are doubled by another’s sympathetic participation; and the
pleasures of another are added to the egoistic pleasures. Thus,
round the physical feeling, forming the nucleus of the whole, are
gathered the feelings produced by personal beauty, that
constituting simple attachment, those of reverence, of love of
approbation, of self-esteem, of property, of love of freedom,
of sympathy. These, all greatly exalted, and severally tending
to reflect their excitements on one another, unite to form the
mental state we call Love.</p>

<p>New truths, old truths! sirs, there is nothing new possible
to be revealed to us in the moral world; we know all we shall
ever know: and it is for simply reminding us, by their various
respective expedients, how we do know this and the other matter,
that men get called prophets, poets, and the like. A philosopher’s
life is spent in discovering that, of the half-dozen truths he knew
when a child, such an one is a lie, as the world states it in set
terms; and then, after a weary lapse of years, and plenty of hard-thinking,
it becomes a truth again after all, as he happens to newly
consider it and view it in a different relation with the others:
and so he restates it, to the confusion of somebody else in good
time. As for adding to the original stock of truths,—impossible!</p>

<p>The law of equal freedom which Herbert Spencer deduces
is binding only upon those who admit both that human happiness
is the Divine Will and that we should act in accordance with the
Divine Will. Why should I obey this law? Because without
such obedience human happiness cannot be complete. Why
should I aim at human happiness? Because human happiness
is the Divine Will. The inexorable <i>why</i> pursues us here—Why
should I aim at the fulfilment of the Divine Will? To this
question there seems no satisfactory reply but that it is for my
own happiness to do so.</p>

W. drew <i>powerful</i> attention to, and confine myself to pointing
out those characteristics in external nature which he took note
of. These produce corresponding feelings in the “human,”
and some of them are <i>beauty</i>, <i>silence and calm</i>, <i>joyousness</i>, <i>generosity</i>,
<i>freedom</i>, <i>grandeur</i>, and <i>Spirituality</i>. These are found in
Nature, and W. saw them, and in the growing familiarity with
them a man’s soul becomes <i>beautiful</i>, <i>calm</i>, <i>joyous</i>, <i>generous</i>,
<i>free</i>, <i>grand</i>, and <i>spiritual</i>. The first ones, of course, all depend on
and grow from the last, and the Spirituality is God immanent.
This last, as the root of all the others, will merit special attention—it
exhibits W.’s poetico-philosophy so far as it regards the work
of Nature upon man; and includes too the Platonic Reminiscence
business. (<i>Here follows personal chit-chat.</i>) I think we
might add the “supreme loftiness of <i>labour</i>” to the foregoing
elements in Nature. In the <i>Gipsies</i> (I give both readings)</p>

<p>In 1877 Blake was little appreciated. (I remember only that in
our children’s books we had “Tiger, Tiger burning bright”—and it was a
strange thing to include in such books a poem which raises the problems of
the existence of evil and the nature of God). Hence it will be evident
why so keen a student of poetry as Hodgson did not couple Blake with
Cowper as a precursor of the Romantic Revival. As a matter of fact
Blake had more of the “Romantic” spirit than Cowper, and really preceded
him, for the poor verse that Cowper published the year before Blake’s
<i>Poetical Sketches</i> need not be considered. While still in his teens Blake
wrote (“To the Muses”):</p>

<p>The preceding poem by Lyall had the same title as these verses,
“Meditation of a Hindu Prince <i>and Sceptic</i>” when first published in the
<i>Cornhill</i>, September, 1877. I was fully convinced, for reasons that would
take too long to set out here, that these verses were by Hodgson. But
Mrs. Piper, the well-known trance-medium, says that Hodgson gave her
a copy signed with other initials than his, and that she is sure he was not
the author. She has mislaid the copy she refers to. In view of this statement
I must not attribute the verses to Hodgson, although I cannot but
doubt whether Mrs. Piper’s recollection is correct.</p>

<p>The present writer ... was seated in a railway-carriage,
five minutes or so before starting, and had time to contemplate
certain waggons or trucks filled with cattle, drawn up on a parallel
line, and quite close to the window at which he sat. The cattle
wore a much-enduring aspect; and, as he looked into their
large, patient, melancholy eyes,—for, as before mentioned, there
was no space to speak of intervening,—a feeling of puzzlement
arose in his mind.... The much-enduring animals in the trucks
opposite had unquestionably some rude twilight of a notion of a
world; of objects they had some unknown cognizance; but he
could not get behind the melancholy eye within a yard of him
and look through it. How, from that window, the world shaped
itself, he could not discover, could not even fancy; and yet,
staring on the animals, he was conscious of a certain fascination
in which there lurked an element of terror. These wild, unkempt
brutes, with slavering muzzles, penned together, lived, could choose
between this thing and the other, could be frightened, could be
enraged, could even love and hate; and gazing into a placid, heavy
countenance, and the depths of a patient eye, not a yard away, he
was conscious of an obscure and shuddering recognition of a life
akin so far with his own. But to enter into that life imaginatively,
and to conceive it, he found impossible. Eye looked upon eye, but
the one could not flash recognition on the other; and, thinking
of this, he remembers, with what a sense of ludicrous horror,
the idea came,—what, if looking on one another thus, some spark
of recognition could be elicited; if some rudiment of thought
could be detected; if there were indeed a point at which man
and ox could meet and compare notes? Suppose some gleam
or scintillation of humour had lighted up the unwinking, amber
eye? Heavens, the bellow of the weaning calf would be pathetic,
shoe-leather would be forsworn, the eating of roast meat, hot
or cold, would be cannibalism, the terrified world would make a
sudden dash into vegetarianism!</p>

<p>Does not this give the reason why we do not eat dogs and horses?
We, more than other nations, recognize in the horse, as well as in the dog,
a life and intelligence akin to our own. We also believe that both animals
reciprocate the affection we feel towards them. (Coleridge in <i>Table Talk</i>
says: “The dog alone, of all brute animals, has a στοργή or affection
<i>upwards</i> to man.”)</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Jeremy Bentham</span> (1748-1832).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>These cold-blooded and repulsive aphorisms are typical of Bentham’s
Utilitarian philosophy, from which all sense of duty and moral aspiration
were excluded. It is strange that these views should be held by a great
thinker who was himself of benevolent character. Such a doctrine could not
have survived to my time, had it not been supplemented by John Stuart
Mill (1806-1873), who gave a different place to the humanist element. While
still adhering to Bentham’s doctrine that there is no good but pleasure and no
evil but pain, he introduced as the higher forms of pleasure those derived
from the wish for self-culture and the desire to satisfy our mental and moral
aims. He gave priority to all the sympathetic and altruistic motives that
govern our actions. Whereas Bentham held that all pleasures were equal and
could be counted in one column, Mill said that they differed in quality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
that they could no more be added up in one column than pounds, shillings
and pence; that, in fact, there is no equivalent for a higher pleasure in any
quantity of a lower one. This was typical of Mill’s sincerity: but he did
not see that his additions were fatal to Bentham’s doctrine and to hedonism
generally. How, for instance, is a higher pleasure to be known for a higher?
In what respect is an intellectual pleasure or the satisfaction of doing one’s
duty of higher quality than the gratification of the senses? To ascertain
this it is necessary to pass from the pleasure itself to the thing that gives
the pleasure or, in other words, to the character that finds the pleasure.
Many illustrations of this might be given. In one of Sir Alfred Lyall’s
poems, which is founded on fact, an Englishman who has been captured by
Arabs has no religious belief; his loved ones are waiting his return; he can
save his life if he will only repeat the Mahomedan formula; if he dies no
one will know of his self-sacrifice: yet he decides to die for the honour of
England. However, Bentham’s careful calculus of equal pleasures and
pains, “push-pin” being “worth as much as poetry,”<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> came to an end
through Mill, and Mill at once made way for Spencer on the one hand, and
T. H. Green on the other; both of these rejected the calculation of pleasures
or happiness as the standard of right either for the individual or the greatest
number. In all directions the low moral stage of philosophic thought
represented by Benthamism has been passed through and forgotten. We
no longer hold the belief that the only sphere of Government is to protect
our persons and property, but follow loftier ideals; and in art and poetry
we look for higher aims than mere luxury and sensuous pleasure.</p>

<p>This haunting little lyric is a literary curiosity from one point of
view. In spite of expostulations from the author (a Belgian poet), and
repeated public statements by others from time to time, the poem is constantly
being wrongly attributed to one or another of the French poets.
It appeared in <i>Le Parnasse de la Jeune Belgique</i>, 1887, but had probably
been written and published some years before that date. In the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i>, September, 1893, William Sharp pointed out that the poem
was always being attributed to the wrong author—even Andrew Lang
being one of the culprits. The author himself wrote to <i>The Literary World</i> of
June 3, 1904, to the same effect. The subject was again spoken of in
<i>Notes and Queries</i>, January 5, 1907, when the author’s letter was republished.
London <i>Truth</i> also brought the matter up at one time, and probably the
same fact has been publicly pointed out elsewhere a hundred times—but
the poem continues to be attributed to the wrong author! In the <i>Dictionary
of Foreign Phrases and Classical Quotations</i>, by H. P. Jones, published
so recently as 1913, the verses are ascribed to Alfred de Musset.</p>

<p>There is a third verse, which reads like an answer or retort to the other
two:</p>

<p>Whatever else may or may not work on through eternity,
we are bound to believe that the love, which moved the Father
to redeem the world at such infinite cost, must work on, while
there is one pang in the universe, born of sin, which can touch
the Divine pity, or one wretched prodigal in rags and hunger
far from the home and the heart of God.</p>

<p>Canon Farrar is not happy in his rejoinder to the argument
that to cast a doubt on the endlessness of punishment is to
invalidate the argument for the endlessness of bliss, since both
rest on exactly the same Biblical sanction. There are three
replies, cumulatively exhaustive, which he has failed to adduce....
(Firstly, evil and temptation are banished from heaven;
Second, the two arguments do <i>not</i> rest on the same Biblical
sanction) ... Thirdly, the difference of the two eternities, heaven
and hell, consists in the presence or absence of God. Let us put α
for each of those eternities or aeons, and θ to denote Him. The
assertion of the equality of the two, then, is that α + θ = α - θ,
which can stand only if θ = 0, the postulate of atheism.</p>

<p>Both these passages come from an Article in the <i>Contemporary</i> for

<p>As this book is partly intended to revive the memories of forty years
ago, I include these out of the passages in my commonplace book which
refer to the intense struggle that then raged over the question of Eternal
Punishment. Surely no other word, since the world began, raised so
tremendous an issue, created such conflict and caused so much heart-burning
as the one word αἰώνιος.</p>

<p>(Liddell and Scott, 1901, gives the following meanings for αἰώνιος:
<i>lasting for an age</i>, <i>perpetual</i>, <i>everlasting</i>, <i>eternal</i>.)</p>

<p>I thank God, and with joy I mention it, I was never afraid
of Hell, nor never grew pale at the description of that place. I
have so fixed my contemplations on Heaven, that I have almost
forgot the Idea of Hell, and am afraid rather to lose the joys
of the one, than endure the misery of the other: to be deprived
of them is a perfect Hell, and needs, methinks, no addition to
compleat our afflictions. That terrible term hath never detained
me from sin, nor do I owe any good action to the name thereof.
I fear GOD, yet am not afraid of Him: His Mercies make me
ashamed of my sins, before His Judgments afraid thereof.</p>

<p>During the horrible time of the Borgia Pope, Alexander VI,
a French priest and a Jew became very intimate friends. The
priest, very anxious for the future welfare of his friend, urged
him to be received into the church: and the Jew promised
to earnestly consider this advice. The priest, however, gave up
all hope on learning that the Jew was called by his business to
Rome, where he would see the unutterably monstrous life of the
Pope and clergy. To his surprise the Jew on his return announced
that he wished to be baptized, saying that a religion, which could
still exist in spite of such abominations, must be the true religion.</p>

<p>I do not know whose paraphrase this is; it was prefixed by Tyndall
to his Belfast Address, 1874. He probably imagined that these lines contained
an argument in favour of materialism; but on the contrary the
Greek philosopher affirms the existence of a supreme God. All that he
says is that the conception of him as resembling a mortal in his physical
attributes is wrong.</p>

<p>At the back of Tyndall’s mind was no doubt the prevalent idea that
any “anthropomorphic” conception of the <i>nature</i> of the Deity is necessarily
absurd. But there is nothing unreasonable in believing that His nature,
though immeasurably superior, is nevertheless <i>akin</i> to our own. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
argument is that the source or power of the world must be greater than
the highest thing it has produced, the mind of man; and that it must more
nearly resemble the higher than the lower of its products. In particular
it is impossible for us to believe that our moral ideas of truth, justice, right
and wrong, etc., can differ at all in <i>kind</i>, however much in <i>degree</i>, from
those of God. So also our <i>reason</i> must be akin to His <i>insight</i>. Such a
belief should be regarded, not as “anthropomorphic,” but as (in a sense
different from that of Clifford and Harrison) a “deification of man”—the
recognition of the Divine that is in him.</p>

<p>To see the soul as she really is, not as we now behold her,
marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you
must contemplate her with the eye of reason, in her original
purity—and then her beauty will be revealed.... We must
remember that we have seen her only in a condition which may
be compared to that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose original
image can hardly be discerned because his natural members
are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all
sorts of ways, and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed
and shells and stones, so that he is more like some monster than
his own natural form. And the soul which we behold is in a
similar condition, disfigured by ten thousand ills. But not there,
Glaucon, not there must we look.</p>

<p>Where then!</p>

<p>At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what
society and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with
the immortal and eternal and divine; also how different she would
become if wholly following this superior principle, and borne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is, and
disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and
rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds
upon earth, and is overgrown by the good things of this life as
they are termed: then you would see her as she is, and know ...
what her nature is.</p>

<p>Apart from the intrinsic interest of such a passage, the picture of the
old sea-god, with long hair and long beard, his body ending in a scaly
tail, battered about by the waves, and overgrown with seaweed and shells,
is very curious. Without discussing how far the great philosopher himself
or some other advanced thinkers believed in such divinities, it must be

<p>“R.K.” is Rudyard Kipling, but what was the “boy’s eccentric
blunder” that brought him success I do not know. Stephen in this instance
showed a want of judgment. The books Kipling had then produced,
<i>Plain Tales from the Hills</i>, <i>Departmental Ditties</i>, and the six little books,
<i>Soldiers Three</i>, etc., all written before the age of twenty-four, should have
been sufficient to show that the author was certainly not a stripling to be
“muzzled.” Stephen’s misjudgment was, however, trivial when we
remember how many important writers have failed to understand and appreciate
the most beautiful poems. Jeffrey (1773-1850) thought to the end
of his days that of the poets of his time Keats and Shelley would die and
Campbell and Rogers alone survive. Shelley was <i>very</i> unfortunate in his
critics. Matthew Arnold and Carlyle also disparaged him, Theodore Hook
said “Prometheus Unbound” was properly named as no one would think
of binding it; and worst of all was Emerson. He said Shelley was not a
poet, had no imagination and his muse was uniformly imitative (“Thoughts
on Modern Literature”); his poetry was ‘rhymed English’ which ‘had
no charm’ (“Poetry and Imagination”). Just as amazing was the article
in <i>The Edinburgh Review</i>, 1816, on Coleridge’s volume containing “Christabel,”
“Kubla Khan,” etc. This article, usually attributed to Hazlitt, and
certainly having Jeffrey’s sanction, said: “We look upon this publication
as one of the most notable pieces of impertinence of which the press has
lately been guilty; and one of the boldest experiments that have as yet
been made upon the patience or understanding of the public.” De Quincey
said the style of Keats “belonged essentially to the vilest collections of
waxwork filigree or gilt gingerbread.” Other instances are Swinburne’s
abuse of George Eliot and Walt Whitman, Carlyle’s brutality towards
Lamb, Jeffrey’s savage attack on Wordsworth (the famous “This will
never do” article—although it was not so very inexcusable), Edward
Fitzgerald’s letter that Mrs. Browning’s death was a relief to him (“No
more Aurora Leighs, thank God!”), Samuel Rogers’ statement that he
“could not relish Shakespeare’s sonnets,” and Steevens’ far worse condemnation
of them, and indeed the list could be extended indefinitely. On the
other hand, unmerited praise was given by whole generations of writers
to poems which are now properly forgotten. In face of such facts it is
somewhat of a mystery why the best things <i>do</i> survive. See next quotation.</p>

<p>If it be true, and it can scarcely be disputed, that nothing
has been for centuries consecrated by public admiration, without
possessing in a high degree some kind of sterling excellence, it
is not because the average intellect and feeling of the majority
of the public are competent in any way to distinguish what is
really excellent, but because all erroneous opinion is inconsistent,
and all ungrounded opinion transitory; so that while the fancies
and feelings which deny deserved honour, and award what is
undue, have neither root nor strength sufficient to maintain
consistent testimony for a length of time, the opinions formed
on right grounds by those few who are in reality competent
judges, being necessarily stable, communicate themselves
gradually from mind to mind, descending lower as they extend
wider, until they leaven the whole lump, and rule by absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
authority, even where the grounds and reasons for them cannot
be understood. On this gradual victory of what is consistent
over what is vacillating, depends the reputation of all that is highest
in art and literature.</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>This is an excellent suggestion in explanation of the question raised
in the preceding note. It is also interesting because of the youth of this
great writer at the time. Ruskin was born in 1819, and the volume was
<i>published</i> in 1843, when he was twenty-four. Because of his youth, it was
thought inadvisable to give his name as author, and, therefore, the book
was published as “by an Oxford Graduate.”</p>

<p>The ages have exulted in the manners of a youth, who owed
nothing to fortune, and who was hanged at the Tyburn of his
nation, who, by the pure quality of his nature, shed an epic
splendour around the facts of his death, which has transfigured
every particular into an universal symbol for the eyes of mankind.
This great defeat is hitherto our highest fact.</p>

<p>In the present day it is not easy to find a well-meaning man
among our more earnest thinkers, who will not take upon himself
to dispute the whole system of redemption, because he cannot
unravel the mystery of the punishment of sin. But can he
unravel the mystery of the punishment of NO sin? Can he
entirely account for all that happens to a cab-horse? Has he
ever looked fairly at the fate of one of those beasts as it is dying—measured
the work it has done, and the reward it has got—put
his hand upon the bloody wounds through which its bones
are piercing, and so looked up to Heaven with an entire understanding
of Heaven’s ways about the horse? Yet the horse is
a fact—no dream—no revelation among the myrtle trees by night;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and the dust it dies upon, and the dogs that eat it, are facts;
and yonder happy person, whose the horse was, till its knees were
broken over the hurdles; who had an immortal soul to begin with,
and wealth and peace to help forward his immortality; who
has also devoted the powers of his soul, and body, and wealth,
and peace, to the spoiling of houses, the corruption of the innocent,
and the oppression of the poor; and has, at this actual moment
of his prosperous life, as many curses waiting round about him in
calm shadow, with their death-eyes fixed upon him, biding their
time, as ever the poor cab-horse had launched at him in meaningless
blasphemies, when his failing feet stumbled at the stones,—this
happy person shall have no stripes,—shall have only
the horse’s fate of annihilation! Or, if other things are indeed
reserved for him, Heaven’s kindness or omnipotence is to be
doubted therefore!</p>

<p>We cannot reason of these things. But this I know—and this
may by all men be known—that no good or lovely thing exists
in this world without its correspondent darkness; and that the
universe presents itself continually to mankind under the stern
aspect of warning, or of choice, the good and the evil set on the
right hand and the left.</p>

<p>A world without a contingency or an agony could have no hero
and no saint, and enable no Son of Man to discover that he was a
Son of God. But for the suspended plot, that is folded in every
life, history is a dead chronicle of what was known before as well
as after; art sinks into the photograph of a moment, that hints
at nothing else; and poetry breaks the cords and throws the lyre
away. There is no Epic of the certainties; and no lyric without
the surprise of sorrow and the sigh of fear. Whatever touches and
ennobles us in the lives and in the voices of the past is a divine
birth from human doubt and pain. Let then the shadows lie, and
the perspective of the light still deepen beyond our view; else,
while we walk together, our hearts will never burn within us as
we go, and the darkness as it falls, will deliver us into no hand
that is Divine.</p>

<p>The subject of the sermon is the <i>uncertainties</i> of life, the perils and
catastrophies that cannot be foreseen or provided for, death, disease,
and other ills which may fall upon us at any moment, the crises that arise
in the history of men and nations. It is by reason of these that <i>character</i>
is formed. If everything happened by known rule, and could be predicted
as surely as the movements of the stars, we should have no affections or
emotions and would be mere creatures of habit.</p>

<p>From a recent book of poems, <i>The Lily of Malud</i>, by J. C. Squire,
I take the following musical verse. (“The Stronghold” is where pain,
hate, and all unpleasant things are excluded and peace only reigns.)</p>

<p>Martineau not only did important work in philosophy, but he was
also eminent as a moral teacher. Taking together his originality, sublimity
of soul, and beauty of expression, the sermons in <i>Hours of Thought</i> and
other similar writings are the finest product of modern religious thought.
They indeed stand among the best productions of our <i>literature</i>, and should
be read even by those (if there are any such persons) who love literature
and thought but are indifferent to religion. To illustrate this, I choose—almost
at random—a passage where the thought itself has no interest
outside religion (<i>Hours of Thought</i>, II. 334):—</p>

<p>Worship is the free offering of ourselves to God; ever renewed,
because ever imperfect. It expresses the consciousness that we are
His by right, yet have not duly passed into His hand; that the soul
has no true rest but in Him, yet has wandered in strange flights until
her wing is tired. It is her effort to return home, the surrender again
of her narrow self-will, her prayer to be merged in a life diviner than her
own. It is at once the lowliest and loftiest attitude of her nature:
we never hide ourselves in ravine so deep; yet overhead we never
see the stars so clear and high. The sense of saddest estrangement,
yet the sense also of eternal affinity between us and God meet and
mingle in the act; breaking into the strains, now penitential and now
jubilant, that, to the critic’s reason, may sound at variance but melt
into harmony in the ear of a higher love. This twofold aspect devotion
must ever have, pale with weeping, flushed with joy; deploring the
past, trusting for the future; ashamed of what is, kindled by what
is meant to be; shadow behind, and light before. Were we haunted
by no presence of sin and want, we should only browse on the pasture
of nature; were we stirred by no instinct of a holier kindred, we should
not be drawn towards the life of God.</p>

<p>Once in an age, God sends to some of us a friend who loves
in us, <i>not</i> a false imagining, an unreal character—but, looking
through all the rubbish of our imperfections, loves in us the divine
ideal of our nature—loves, not the man that we are, but the angel
that we may be. Such friends seem inspired by a divine gift
of prophecy—like the mother of St. Augustine, who, in the midst
of the wayward, reckless youth of her son, beheld him in a vision,
standing, clothed in white, a ministering priest at the right hand
of God—as he has stood for long ages since. Could a mysterious
foresight unveil to us this resurrection form of the friends with
whom we daily walk, compassed about with mortal infirmity, we
should follow them with faith and reverence through all the
disguises of human faults and weaknesses, “waiting for the
manifestation of the sons of God.”</p>

<p>Here two fine thoughts of Mrs. Stowe and Mrs. Browning are inspired
by the vision of Monica, the saintly mother of the great St. Augustine
(354-430).</p>

<p>This is a good illustration of the need of notes. Without a reference
to St. Monica’s vision, I think that readers would be repelled, rather than
attracted, by Mrs. Browning’s sonnet. It does not accord with one’s sense
of modesty that a lady should say to her lover, “My unattractive person
and incurable illness turned other men away, but you saw that, behind all
this, I was ‘a patient <i>angel</i> waiting for a place in the new Heavens.’”
I myself could not understand how Mrs. Browning could write and her
husband could publish this poem, until Hodgson, in one of his letters to
me, referred to “the use made by Mrs. Browning of St. Monica’s vision in
one of her sonnets.”</p>

<p>The sonnet is not quoted as one of the finest of the series.</p>

<p>I have placed Mrs. Stowe’s quotation first for an obvious reason; but
<i>The Minister’s Wooing</i> was published in 1859, while the sonnet appeared
in 1847.</p>

<p>As Coleridge says in the last quotation, “We receive but what we give.”
We bring with us the mind that sees, and the feelings and emotions with
which we contemplate the universe; and, so far as use, habit, and other
causes still the activity and lessen the receptivity of the mind and spirit,
the world around us becomes less instinct with life and beauty.</p>

<p>Putting aside the question whether, as Wordsworth says in his great
Ode,</p>

<p>it will be familiar to anyone who has a sympathetic, appreciative sense
that the <i>child’s</i> outlook on the world around him is very different from our
own. It has in him a more intense emotional reaction. He sees it with
a freshness and wonder unfelt by us, because our sensibility is blunted and
less vivid. And for the same reason that we trust our faculties in their
prime rather than in their degeneration, so the fresh and clear emotional
response of a child’s nature represents more <i>truthful</i> appreciation than our
own. Our sensibility is blunted, not only by use and habit, but also by
the hardening and coarsening experiences of our lives; and also again by the
development of intellect, which grows largely at the expense of the emotions.
We lose the transparent soul of the child, his simple faith and trusting
nature. To anyone who cannot <i>feel</i> the difference between the child’s
outlook and his own, this will convey no meaning—and words cannot assist
him. It is as if one tried to describe love to a person who has never loved,
or a religious experience to one who has never had such an experience,
indeed, in both love and religious experience, there is the same child-like
attitude of pure emotion; and hence Christ’s comparison of His true followers
to “little children.” Poetry, music, love of nature, and the highest art
produce in us at times the same indefinable feeling and give us back for
evanescent periods the fresh, clear, emotional sensibility of a child.</p>

<p>In Edward Fitzgerald’s <i>Euphranor</i>, at the point where Wordsworth’s
ode is being discussed, the following passage is interesting:—</p>

<p>“I have heard tell of another poet’s saying that he knew of no human
outlook so solemn as that from an infant’s eyes; and how it was from those
of his own he learned that those of the Divine Child in Raffaelle’s Sistine
Madonna were not overcharged with expression, as he had previously
thought they might be.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “that was on the occasion, I think, of his having watched
his child one morning <i>worshipping the sunbeam on the bedpost</i>—I suppose
the worship of wonder.... If but the philosopher or poet could live
in the child’s brain for a while!”</p>

in question, Vol. I., 357).</p>

<p>The normal process of life contains moments as bad as any
of those which insane melancholy is filled with. The lunatic’s
visions of horror are all drawn from the material of daily fact.
Our civilization is founded on the shambles, and every individual
existence goes out in a lonely spasm of helpless agony. If you
protest, my friend, wait till you arrive there yourself!<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> To
believe in the carnivorous reptiles of geologic times is hard for our
imagination—they seem too much like mere museum specimens.
Yet there is no tooth in any one of those museum-skulls that
did not daily, through long years of the foretime, hold fast to
the body struggling in despair of some fated living victim. Forms
of horror just as dreadful to their victims, if on a smaller spatial
scale, fill the world about us to-day. Here on our very hearths and
in our gardens the infernal cat plays with the panting mouse, or
holds the hot bird fluttering in her jaws. Crocodiles and rattlesnakes
and pythons are at this moment vessels of life as real as we are;
their loathsome existence fills every minute of every day that
drags its length along, and whenever they or other wild beasts
clutch their living prey, the deadly horror which an agitated
melancholiac feels is the literally right reaction on the situation.</p>

<p>Arcadia was a mountainous district in Greece which was taken to be
the deal of pastoral simplicity and rural happiness—as in Sir Philip
Sidney’s <i>Arcadia</i> and other literature. It was famous for its musicians and
a favourite haunt of Pan.</p>

<p>The saying is best known from the fine landscape in the Louvre by N.
Poussin (1594-1665). In part of the landscape is a tomb on which these
words are written, and some young people are seen reading them. I learn,
however, from <i>King’s Classical and Foreign Quotations</i> that the words had
been previously written on a picture by Bart. Schidone (1570-1615), where
two young shepherds are looking at a skull.</p>

<p>The meaning intended was that <i>death</i> came even to the joyous shepherds
of Arcady. But the quotation is now used in a more general sense. “I
too had my golden days of youth and love and happiness.”</p>

<p>Why describe our life-history as a state of waking rather than
of sleep? Why assume that sleep is the acquired, vigilance
the normal condition? It would not be hard to defend the
opposite thesis. The newborn infant might urge with cogency
that his habitual state of slumber was primary, as regards the individual,
ancestral as regards the race; resembling at least, far more
closely than does our adult life, a primitive or protozoic habit.
“Mine,” he might say, “is a centrally stable state. It would
need only some change in external conditions (as the permanent
immersion in a nutritive fluid) to be safely and indefinitely
maintained. Your waking state, on the other hand, is centrally
unstable. While you talk and bustle around me you are living
on your physiological capital, and the mere prolongation of
vigilance is torture and death.”</p>

<p>A paradox such as this forms no part of my argument; but it
may remind us that physiology at any rate hardly warrants
us in speaking of our waking state as if that alone represented
our true selves, and every deviation from it must be at best
a mere interruption. Vigilance in reality is but one of two
co-ordinate phases of our personality, which we have acquired
or differentiated from each other during the stages of our long
evolution.</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">F. W. H. Myers</span> (<i>Multiplex Personality</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<div class="notes">

<p>This is from an article in <i>The Nineteenth Century</i> for November, 1886,
in which Myers urged the study of the trance-personalities that exhibit
themselves under hypnotism. In his <i>Human Personality and Its Survival
of Bodily Death</i> his views on sleep may be very briefly summarized as follows:
In the low forms of animal life there is an undifferentiated state, neither
sleep nor waking, and this is also seen in our prenatal and earliest infantile
life. In life generally the waking time can exist only for brief periods
continuously. We cannot continue life without resort to the fuller vitality
which sleep brings to us. Again, from the original undifferentiated state,
our waking life has been developed by practical needs; the faculties required
for our earthly life then become intensified, but by natural selection other
faculties and sensations (including those which connect us with the spiritual
world) are dropped out of our consciousness. The state of sleep cannot be
regarded as the mere <i>absence of waking faculties</i>. In this state we have some
faint glimmer of the other faculties and sensations in various forms—dreams,
somnambulism, etc. Myers then develops the theory that the relations
of hysteria and <i>genius</i> to ordinary life correspond to those of somnambulism
and hypnotic trance to sleep; and he arrives at the question of self-suggestion
and hypnotism generally.</p>

<p>Thus in sleep there are, <i>first</i>, certain physiological changes (including
a greater control of the physical organism, as seen in the muscular powers
of somnambulists); no length of time spent lying down awake in darkness
and silence will give the recuperative effect that even a few moments of
sleep will give. But also, <i>secondly</i>, we find existing in sleep the other
faculties withdrawn from use in ordinary waking life. Thus during sleep
we find memory revived, problems unexpectedly solved, poems like “Kubla
Khan” composed, and many intense sensations and emotions experienced.
Beyond these powers again Myers finds in sleep still higher powers which
seem to connect us with the spiritual world. Hence the advisability of
studying the phenomena of sleep and investigating it <i>experimentally</i> by
employing hypnotism.</p>

<p>William James adopted much the same view as Myers (see, for example,
<i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>). But much has been written of late
about sub-consciousness and about dreams; and the tendency is rather
to follow Martineau’s view of mental development—that the lower nervous
centres are unconscious “habits” deposited from the old intelligence (<a href="#Page_304">see
p. 304</a>). Thus, for instance, memories of the past would be recorded in the
sub-conscious, but there is nothing to be found there <i>of a higher character</i>
than in the conscious self. In sleep, the waking control being removed,
our dreams reveal impulses and desires that have been inhibited or kept
under in waking life, but do not reveal anything of the <i>higher</i> indicated
by Myers. However, although it is too large a subject to discuss here, there
is a vast deal yet to be explained, as, for example, inspiration, and what we
used to call “unconscious cerebration,” and the amazing results of hypnotism
and suggestion. Also who or what is it that <i>composes</i> the dream-story,
or who or what <i>makes us</i> act or dream the story?</p>

<p>These fresh, clear, spontaneous verses have a special value. They
bring us a promise of Spring—the message that we may still hope for a
revival of English Poetry.</p>

<p>Therefore, I have included them (in this third edition) although they
are outside the general scope of my book.</p>

<p>Miss Betty Bray has been writing since she was seven years of age.
She writes with great facility and has already filled two manuscript books.
Her verses are entirely her own, no defects being pointed out or other
assistance or guidance given her.</p>

<p>She was born on June 11th, 1906. She is the daughter of Mr. Denys de
Saumarez Bray, C.S.I., and the grand-niece of my late partner the Hon. Sir
John Bray, K.C.M.G., who was Premier of South Australia. Her grandfather

<p>On Dreamthorp centuries have fallen, and have left no more
trace than have last winter’s snowflakes. This commonplace
sequence and flowing on of life is immeasurably affecting. That
winter morning when Charles lost his head in front of the
banqueting-hall of his own palace, the icicles hung from the eaves
of the houses here, and the clown kicked the snowballs from his
clouted shoon, and thought but of his supper when, at three
o’clock, the red sun set in the purple mist.... Battles
have been fought, kings have died, history has transacted itself;
but, all unheeding and untouched, Dreamthorp has watched
apples-trees redden, and wheat ripen, and smoked its pipe,
and quaffed its mug of beer, and rejoiced over its newborn children,
and with proper solemnity carried its dead to the churchyard.</p>

<p>Quixotism, or Utopianism: that is another of the devil’s pet
words. I believe the quiet admission which we are all of us
so ready to make, that, because things have long been wrong,
it is impossible they should ever be right, is one of the most
fatal sources of misery and crime from which this world suffers.
Whenever you hear a man dissuading you from attempting
to do well, on the ground that perfection is “Utopian,” beware
of that man. Cast the word out of your dictionary altogether.</p>

<p>Coleridge, I have not one truly elevated character among

<p>Poor lovable Charles Lamb! When he wrote this he was only twenty-one
years of age, he had already been himself confined in an asylum, and
now his sister in a moment of madness had killed her mother. When afterwards
he was allowed to take care of Mary, he had still to take her back to the
asylum from time to time, as a fresh attack of mania began to manifest
itself. The picture of the weeping brother and sister on their way to the
asylum is dreadfully sad. The passage seems interesting because of Lamb’s
reference to Wesley.</p>

<p>The huge mass of black crags that towered at the head of the
gloomy defile was exactly what one would picture as the enchanted
castle of the evil magician, within sight of which all vegetation
withered, looking from over the desolate valley of ruins to the
barren shore strewed with its sad wreckage, and the wild ocean
beyond....</p>

<p>The land-crabs certainly looked their part of goblin guardians
of the approaches to the wicked magician’s fastness. They were
fearful as the firelight fell on their yellow cynical faces, fixed
as that of the sphinx, but fixed in a horrid grin. Those who have
observed this foulest species of crab will know my meaning.
Smelling the fish we were cooking they came down the mountains
in thousands upon us. We threw them lumps of fish, which they
devoured with crab-like slowness, yet perseverance.</p>

<p>It is a ghastly sight, a land-crab at his dinner. A huge beast
was standing a yard from me; I gave him a portion of fish, and
watched him. He looked at me straight in the face with his
outstarting eyes, and proceeded with his two front claws to tear
up his food, bringing bits of it to his mouth with one claw, as with
a fork. But all this while he never looked at what he was doing;
his face was fixed in one position, staring at me. And when
I looked around, lo! there were half a dozen others all steadily
feeding, but with immovable heads turned to me with that fixed
basilisk stare. It was indeed horrible, and the effect was nightmarish
in the extreme. While we slept that night they attacked
us, and would certainly have devoured us, had we not awoke;
and did eat holes in our clothes. One of us had to keep watch,
so as to drive them from the other two, otherwise we should have
had no sleep.</p>

<p>Imagine a sailor cast alone on this coast, weary, yet unable to
sleep a moment on account of these ferocious creatures. After a
few days of an existence full of horror he would die raving mad,
and then be consumed in an hour by his foes. In all Dante’s
Inferno there is no more horrible a suggestion of punishment
than this.</p>

<p>I confess that I do not see why the very existence of an invisible
world may not in part depend on the personal response
which any one of us may make to the religious appeal. God himself,
in short, may draw vital strength and increase of very being
from our fidelity. For my own part, I do not know what the sweat
and blood and tragedy of this life mean, if they mean anything
short of this. If this life be not a real fight, in which something
is eternally gained for the universe by success, it is no better
than a game of private theatricals from which one may withdraw
at will. But it <i>feels</i> like a real fight,—as if there were something
really wild in the universe which we, with all our idealities and
faithfulnesses, are needed to redeem; and first of all to redeem our
own hearts from atheisms and fears. For such a half-wild,
half-saved universe our nature is adapted. The deepest thing in
our nature is this dumb region of the heart in which we dwell
alone with our willingnesses and unwillingnesses, our faiths
and fears.... In these depths of personality the sources of
all our outer deeds and decisions take their rise. Here is our
deepest organ of communication with the nature of things; and
compared with these concrete movements of our soul all abstract
statements and scientific arguments—the veto, for example,
which the strict positivist pronounces upon our faith—sound to
us like mere chatterings of the teeth.</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>(Mr. T. R. Glover in <i>The Jesus of History</i> points out that when Christ
said “Ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations”
(Luke xxii, 26), He meant that the disciples had <i>helped Him</i> by their
fidelity.)</p>

<p>The following is from Professor Hobhouse’s <i>Questions of War and
Peace</i>, repeating what he had set out at length in his <i>Development and
Purpose</i> (I take the quotation from <i>The Spectator</i> review, as the book
is not yet procurable in Australia):</p>

<p>“I think, therefore, that we must go back into ourselves for faith, and
away from ourselves into the world for reason. The deeper we go into ourselves
the more we throw off forms and find the assurance not only that the
great things exist, but that they are the heart of our lives, and, since after
all we are of one stock, they must be at the heart of your lives as well as mine.
You say there are bad men and wars and cruelties and wrong, I say all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
these are the collision of undeveloped forms. What is the German suffering
from but a great illusion that the State is something more than man, and
that power is more than justice! Strip him of this and he is a man like yourself,
pouring out his blood for the cause that he loves, and that you and I
detest. Probe inwards, then, and you find the same spring of life everywhere
and it is good. Look outwards, and you find, as you yourself admit the
slow movement towards a harmony which just means that these impulses
of primeval energy come, so to say, to understand one another. Every
form they take as they grow will provoke conflict, perish, and be cast aside
until the whole unites, and there you have the secret of your successive
efforts and failures which yet leave something behind them. God is not the
creator who made the world in six days, rested on the seventh and saw
that it was good. He is growing in the actual evolution of the world.”</p>

<p>See note to previous quotation. This poem was written in 1883.</p>

<p>Although I preserved these verses, I may add that I had no interest
whatever in spiritualism, permeated as it was with childishness and fraud.
But, nevertheless, it (together with the so-called “Theosophy”) led to the
happy result that the Society for Psychical Research was founded in 1882.
Although spiritualism did good in this way, its unhappy associations do
harm to the Society and hamper it in the important work it has carried
on during the last thirty-eight years. Popular prejudice continues to
associate it with the old spiritualism, and in consequence no proper attention
is paid to its <i>intensely interesting</i> and most valuable investigations. For
example, there are, apart from Public Libraries and Universities, only
six members or associates in the whole of Australia! And yet, besides
important work in other directions, it must be admitted by any open-minded
person that the evidence collected by the Society that the dead
(by telepathy or otherwise) communicate with the living is unanswerable.</p>

<p>Habit dulls the senses and puts the critical faculty to sleep.
The fierceness and hardness of ancient manners is apparent
to us, but the ancients themselves were not shocked by sights
which were familiar to them. To us it is sickening to think
of the gladiatorial show, of the massacres common in Roman
warfare, of the infanticide practised by grave and respectable
citizens, who did not merely condemn their children to death,
but often in practice, as they well knew, to what was still worse—a
life of prostitution and beggary. The Roman regarded a
gladiatorial show as we regard a hunt; the news of the slaughter
of two hundred thousand Helvetians by Cæsar or half a million
Jews by Titus excited in his mind a thrill of triumph; infanticide
committed by a friend appeared to him a prudent measure of
household economy.</p>

<p>It is still more important to realize that the exposure of children was
a recognized practice also among the Greeks, and that no one, not even
Plato, their noblest philosopher, saw anything wrong in it. It is only
by letting the mind dwell on such facts as these, until their significance
is fully appreciated, that we can realize the width and depth of the great
gulf that separates the Pagan and the Christian, the ancient and the modern
world. Take this one fact only: imagine the Greek father looking at his
helpless babe and coldly deciding that to rear it will be inconvenient,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
or that there are already enough children to divide the inheritance, or
that the child is sickly or deformed, or that its person offends his idea of
beauty—and then consigning his own offspring to slavery, prostitution,
or death! (The child would either die or be picked up to be reared for
some such purpose.) Even in the very imperfect state of our own civilization,
we at least have children’s hospitals and crèches, and are inflamed
with righteous rage when even an <i>unknown</i> baby is ill-treated. (We,
indeed, go further, and have laws and societies for prevention of cruelty
to <i>animals</i>.)</p>

<p>The consideration of such a fact leads us also to inquire as to the
relations of husband and wife, seeing that the woman would have at least
the affection for her offspring that is common among the lower animals.
We then find that the modern chivalrous idea of womanhood was unknown
to the Greeks; the wife was not educated, and was considered an inferior
being; she was married mainly in order to provide sons to carry out certain
ritual observances necessary for the father’s welfare after death; she
was kept in an almost Eastern seclusion (and therefore had to improve
her pallid complexion by paint); she would associate mainly with the
children and slaves. We also find that fidelity of the husband to the wife
was neither required nor <i>esteemed</i>; and that there was little marital love
or family life. (Plato in his model Republic would abolish both the latter,
for there was to be promiscuity of women, and all children were to be brought
up by the State.)</p>

<p>Considering further this practice of exposing children, we realize
that it indicates <i>the want of pity for the helpless and suffering</i>, which is
seen among the lower animals (but with exceptions even among them).
From this we may reasonably infer that the Greeks would show little
humanity in treating other helpless or suffering people, the sick or distressed,
dependents or slaves, conquered enemies or others in their power. (In
this respect, however, they, as an intellectual people, would subject themselves
to and be controlled by necessary <i>social</i> laws and <i>practical</i> considerations;
and also, as a fact, they at times showed generosity to a valiant
foe.) Again we can infer that, where even the spirit of mercy was so
wanting, the gospel of <i>love</i> could not possibly exist, and that the Greeks
lived on a far lower <i>moral</i> plane than ours. These questions are far too
large to discuss in this book, and I must leave them to be dealt with elsewhere.</p>

<p>But, even from this very small portion of the available evidence, we
can arrive at three resulting facts: <i>First</i>, that when in translations from
the Greek we find such words as “kindness,” “love,” “morality,” “purity,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
“virtue,” “religion,” etc., they have for us a far larger and higher content
than the Greek words in the original; <i>secondly</i>, that therefore, the reader
must get incorrect impressions of Greek literature and thought; and,
<i>thirdly</i>, that truly marvellous as the Greeks were in art and literature, the
current conception of them as a noble-minded and refined people is erroneous.</p>

<p>In referring to the Greeks, one needs to limit the people and period, and I am referring
to the great age of the Attic or Athenian Greeks, say the Fifth Century, B.C. There
would, of course, be gradations of character among them, and, no doubt, some would be
kind-hearted, others would have affection for their wives, and so on. But this can
only be assumption, for there is little in their literature to support it. This will be seen
if the evidence adduced by Mr. Livingstone (“The Greek Genius,” pp. 117-122) is carefully
and critically examined. (His references to Homer, who lived in a far distant age
must be omitted.) Also the fact that Herodotus, in the course of his narrative, tells us
that some men of another state had a moment of compassion for a baby whom they were
about to slay, does not prove in the slightest degree that he was himself humane. The
wording of Mr. Livingstone’s translation, p. 118, “It happened <i>by a divine chance</i> that
the baby smiled, etc.,” would appear to confirm this view of his; but the Greek words
simply mean that a god by chance intervened. Knowing what we do of the Greek gods,
that intervention would certainly not be actuated by any kindly feeling towards the
infant—the object presumably was that the child should live to fulfil the destiny prophesied
by the Delphic Oracle. (Herodotus was a typical Greek to whom the world was
peopled with gods, and he sees them constantly interposing in human affairs.) As regards
the exposure of children, the point is that <i>it was a recognized and common practice, duly
sanctioned by law, and never condemned by any writer</i>. Indeed Plato and Aristotle definitely
approve of it, and in Plato’s Ideal Republic the weakly and deformed children were to
be killed by the State.</p>

<p>As regards the current conception of the Greeks, Shelley in his “Preface to Hellas”
describes them as “those glorious beings whom the imagination almost refuses to figure
to itself as belonging to our kind.” Similar statements could be gathered from innumerable
English and European writers.</p>

<p>Wordsworth lived at Rydal Mount. These verses were published
in <i>Macmillan’s</i>, 1879.</p>

<p>“<i>Nor something fairer far.</i>” In Sir F. Younghusband’s <i>Kashmir</i>
(1911) there is another suggestion, supplementary to this: “There came
upon me this thought, which doubtless has occurred to many another
besides myself—why the scene should so influence me and yet make no
impression on the men about me. Here were men with far keener eyesight
than my own, and around me were animals with eyesight keener still....
Clearly it is not the eye, but the soul that sees. But then comes the still
further reflection: what may there not be staring <i>me</i> straight in the face
which I am as blind to as the Kashmir stags are to the beauties amidst
which they spend their entire lives? The whole panorama may be vibrating
with beauties man has not yet the soul to see. Some already living, no
doubt, see beauties that we ordinary men cannot appreciate. It is only a
century ago that mountains were looked upon as hideous. And in the long
centuries to come may we not develop a soul for beauties unthought of
now? Undoubtedly we must. And often in reverie on the mountains
I have tried to imagine what still further loveliness they may yet possess
for men.”</p>

<p>If these may be any reasons against children’s making Latin
themes at school, I have much more to say, and of more weight,
against their making verses—verses of any sort. For if he has
no genius to Poetry, ’tis the most unreasonable thing in the world
to torment a child and waste his time about that which can never
succeed; and if he have a poetic vein, ’tis to me the strangest
thing in the world that the father should desire or suffer it to be
cherished or improved. Methinks the parents should labour
to have it stifled and suppressed as much as may be; and I know
not what reason a father can have to wish his son a poet, who
does not desire to have him bid defiance to all other callings and
business.... For it is very seldom seen that any one discovers
mines of gold or silver in Parnassus.... Poetry and Gaming
usually go together.... If, therefore, you would not have
your son the fiddle to every jovial company, without whom the
Sparks could not relish their wine, nor know how to pass an
afternoon idly; if you would not have him to waste his time
and estate to divert others, and contemn the dirty acres left
him by his ancestors, I do not think you will very much care he
should be a Poet.</p>

<p class="center">ON BLACKSTONE’S COMMENTARIES.</p>

<p>In taking leave of our Author (Sir William Blackstone) I finish
gladly with this pleasing peroration: a scrutinizing judgment,
perhaps, would not be altogether satisfied with it; but the ear
is soothed by it, and the heart is warmed.</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Jeremy Bentham</span> (1748-1832) (<i>A Fragment of Government</i>).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>I think it worth while quoting from my notes this amusing piece
of sarcasm aimed by a young man of twenty-eight at the most renowned
legal writer of the time. <i>A Fragment of Government</i> (1776), the first of
Bentham’s works, not only showed the utter folly of Blackstone’s praise
of the English constitution, but also laid the foundation of political science.
(The passage, which the quotation refers to, is in Sec. 2 of the Introduction
to the <i>Commentaries</i>, “Thus far as to the right of the supreme power to
make law ... public tranquillity.”)</p>

<p>Not only was the English constitution a subject of eulogy in Bentham’s
day, but also English law, then in a most barbarous state, was alleged to
be the perfection of human reason! Through the efforts of this great
and original thinker many dreadful abuses were removed, but it is a remarkable
illustration of the blind strength of English conservatism that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
wise counsel has not yet been followed in many exceedingly important
directions.</p>

<p>In the seventy-eighty period, with which this book mainly deals
there was a strong agitation for law reform, which had some results.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was the boast of Augustus, that he found Rome of brick
and left it of marble. But how much nobler will be our Sovereign’s
boast when he shall have it to say that he found law dear,
and left it cheap; found it a sealed book—left it a living letter;
found it the patrimony of the rich—left it the inheritance of the
poor; found it the two-edged sword of craft and oppression—left
it the staff of honesty and the shield of innocence!</p>

<p>When Lord Ellenborough was trying one of the Government
charges against Horne Tooke, he found occasion to praise the
impartial manner in which justice is administered. “In England,
Mr. Tooke, the law is open to all men, rich or poor.” “Yes,
my lord,” answered the prisoner, “and so is the London Tavern.”</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Henry S. Leigh</span> (<i>Jeux d’Esprit</i>).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>The same story is told in Rogers’ <i>Table Talk</i>, but a different judge is
named. (Probably both are wrong, but it is immaterial.) The London
Tavern was where Horne Tooke’s Constitutional Society met, and must
have been often referred to during the trial; but of course the meaning
simply is that the throne of justice cannot be approached with an empty
purse.</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>In the farce, a cloth merchant, who is suing his shepherd for stolen
sheep, discovers also that the attorney on the other side is a man who had
robbed him of some cloth. Dropping the charge against the shepherd,
he begins accusing the lawyer of his offence; and, to recall him to the point,
the judge impatiently interrupts him with <i>Sus revenons à nos moutons</i>,
“Come, let us get back to our sheep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Compare Martial VI, 19: “My suit has nothing to do with assault,
or battery, or poisoning, but is about three goats, which, I complain, have
been stolen by my neighbour. This the judge desires to have proved to
him; but you, with swelling words and extravagant gestures, dilate on the
Battle of Cannae, the Mithridatic war, and the perjuries of the insensate
Carthaginians, the Syllae, the Marii, and the Mucii. It is time, Postumus,
to say something about my three goats.”</p>

<p>(The wife of a poor man deserted him for another man, and he
married again. On being convicted for bigamy Mr. Justice
Maule sentenced him as follows:) Prisoner at the bar: You
have been convicted of the offence of bigamy, that is to say,
of marrying a woman while you had a wife still alive, though it
is true she has deserted you and is living in adultery with another
man. You have, therefore, committed a crime against the laws
of your country, and you have also acted under a very serious
misapprehension of the course which you ought to have pursued.
You should have gone to the ecclesiastical court and there
obtained against your wife a decree <i>a mensa et thoro</i>. You should
then have brought an action in the courts of common law and
recovered, as no doubt you would have recovered, damages against
your wife’s paramour. Armed with these decrees, you should
have approached the legislature and obtained an Act of Parliament
which would have rendered you free and legally competent
to marry the person whom you have taken on yourself to marry
with no such sanction. It is quite true that these proceedings
would have cost you many hundreds of pounds, whereas you
probably have not as many pence. <i>But the law knows no distinction
between rich and poor.</i> The sentence of the court upon
you, therefore, is that you be imprisoned for one day, which period
has already been exceeded, as you have been in custody since
the commencement of the assizes.</p>

<p>I understand that the original wording was “‘Hame’s hamely,’

Hindu appreciates is that of English Law—<i>but not as a system of Justice</i>.
To his acute mind it is a remarkably clever and most ingenious <i>gambling
game</i>. It is said that two Hindus will even fabricate mutual complaints,
the one against the other, to bring before the Courts—and that it is
almost equivalent to a patent of nobility to have had a case taken to the
Privy Council. The following incident actually happened to a friend of
mine who was Resident in a Native State. Sitting in his judicial capacity
he reproved a Hindu gentleman for his excessive litigiousness. The latter
retorted that it was a case of the pot calling the kettle black; that he had
seen the Resident put his rupees on the totalisator the day before; and
the British race-course wasn’t a bit more of a gamble than the British
Law Courts. For his part he preferred to have his flutter on the latter.</p>

<p>Mr. le Gallienne was not the first to complain that poetic subjects
were exhausted. A recent <i>Spectator</i> quotes the following from Choerilus,
a Samian poet of the Fifth Century, B.C. (2,000 years before Shakespeare):
“Happy was the follower of the muses in that time, when the field was
still virgin soil. But now when all has been divided up and the arts have
reached their limits, we are left behind in the race, and, look where’er we
may, there is no room anywhere for a new-yoked chariot to make its way
to the front.” (St. John Thackeray, <i>Anthologia Graeca</i>).</p>

<p>Go out into the woods and valleys, when your heart is rather
harassed than bruised, and when you suffer from vexation more
than grief. Then the trees all hold out their arms to you to relieve
you of the burthen of your heavy thoughts; and the streams under
the trees glance at you as they run by, and will carry away your
trouble along with the fallen leaves; and the sweet-breathing air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
will draw it off together with the silver multitudes of the dew. But
let it be with anguish or remorse in your heart that you go forth
into Nature, and instead of your speaking her language, you make
her speak yours. Your distress is then infused through all things
and clothes all things, and Nature only echoes and seems to
authenticate your self-loathing or your hopelessness. Then you
find the device of your sorrow on the argent shield of the moon,
and see all the trees of the field weeping and wringing their hands
with you, while the hills, seated at your side in sackcloth, look
down upon you prostrate, and reprove you like the comforters
of Job.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">From his shoulder Hiawatha</div>
<div class="verse">Took the camera of rosewood,</div>
<div class="verse">Made of sliding, folding rosewood;</div>
<div class="verse">This he perched upon a tripod—</div>
<div class="verse">Crouched beneath its dusky cover—</div>
<div class="verse">Stretched his hand, enforcing silence—</div>
<div class="verse">Said, “Be motionless, I beg you!”</div>
<div class="verse">Mystic, awful was the process.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">All the family in order</div>
<div class="verse">Sat before him for their pictures:</div>
<div class="verse">Each in turn, as he was taken,</div>
<div class="verse">Volunteered his own suggestions,</div>
<div class="verse">His ingenious suggestions.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">First the Governor, the Father:</div>
<div class="verse">He suggested velvet curtains</div>
<div class="verse">Looped about a massy pillar;</div>
<div class="verse">And the corner of a table,</div>
<div class="verse">Of a rosewood dining-table.</div>
<div class="verse">He would hold a scroll of something,</div>
<div class="verse">Hold it firmly in his left-hand;</div>
<div class="verse">He would keep his right-hand buried</div>
<div class="verse">(Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat;</div>
<div class="verse">He would contemplate the distance</div>
<div class="verse">With a look of pensive meaning,</div>
<div class="verse">As of ducks that die in tempests.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Grand, heroic was the notion:</div>
<div class="verse">Yet the picture failed entirely:</div>
<div class="verse">Failed, because he moved a little,</div>
<div class="verse">Moved, because he couldn’t help it,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Next, his better half took courage;</div>
<div class="verse"><i>She</i> would have her picture taken,</div>
<div class="verse">She came dressed beyond description,</div>
<div class="verse">Dressed in jewels and in satin</div>
<div class="verse">Far too gorgeous for an empress.</div>
<div class="verse">Gracefully she sat down sideways,</div>
<div class="verse">With a simper scarcely human,</div>
<div class="verse">Holding in her hand a bouquet</div>
<div class="verse">Rather larger than a cabbage.</div>
<div class="verse">All the while that she was sitting,</div>
<div class="verse">Still the lady chattered, chattered,</div>
<div class="verse">Like a monkey in the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">“Am I sitting still?” she asked him</div>
<div class="verse">“Is my face enough in profile?</div>
<div class="verse">Shall I hold the bouquet higher?</div>
<div class="verse">Will it come into the picture?”</div>
<div class="verse">And the picture failed completely.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Next the Son, the Stunning-Cantab</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
<div class="verse">He suggested curves of beauty,</div>
<div class="verse">Curves pervading all his figure,</div>
<div class="verse">Which the eye might follow onward,</div>
<div class="verse">Till they centered in the breast-pin,</div>
<div class="verse">Centered in the golden breast-pin.</div>
<div class="verse">He had learnt it all from Ruskin</div>
<div class="verse">And perhaps he had not fully</div>
<div class="verse">Understood his author’s meaning;</div>
<div class="verse">But, whatever was the reason,</div>
<div class="verse">All was fruitless, as the picture</div>
<div class="verse">Ended in an utter failure.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Next to him the eldest daughter:</div>
<div class="verse">She suggested very little,</div>
<div class="verse">Only asked if he would take her</div>
<div class="verse">With her look of “passive beauty.”</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Her idea of passive beauty</div>
<div class="verse">Was a squinting of the left-eye,</div>
<div class="verse">Was a drooping of the right-eye,</div>
<div class="verse">Was a smile that went up sideways</div>
<div class="verse">To the corner of the nostrils.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Hiawatha, when she asked him,</div>
<div class="verse">Took no notice of the question,</div>
<div class="verse">Looked as if he hadn’t heard it;</div>
<div class="verse">But, when pointedly appealed to,</div>
<div class="verse">Smiled in his peculiar manner,</div>
<div class="verse">Coughed and said it “didn’t matter,”</div>
<div class="verse">Bit his lip and changed the subject.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nor in this was he mistaken,</div>
<div class="verse">As the picture failed completely.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">So in turn the other sisters.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Last, the youngest son was taken:</div>
<div class="verse">Very rough and thick his hair was,</div>
<div class="verse">Very round and red his face was,</div>
<div class="verse">Very dusty was his jacket,</div>
<div class="verse">Very fidgety his manner.</div>
<div class="verse">And his overbearing sisters</div>
<div class="verse">Called him names he disapproved of:</div>
<div class="verse">Called him Johnny, “Daddy’s Darling,”</div>
<div class="verse">Called him Jacky, “Scrubby School-boy.”</div>
<div class="verse">And, so awful was the picture,</div>
<div class="verse">In comparison the others</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed, to his bewildered fancy,</div>
<div class="verse">To have partially succeeded.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Finally my Hiawatha</div>
<div class="verse">Tumbled all the tribe together,</div>
<div class="verse">(“Grouped” is not the right expression).</div>
<div class="verse">And, as happy chance would have it,</div>
<div class="verse">Did at last obtain a picture</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Where the faces all succeeded:</div>
<div class="verse">Each came out a perfect likeness.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Then they joined and all abused it,</div>
<div class="verse">Unrestrainedly abused it,</div>
<div class="verse">As “the worst and ugliest picture</div>
<div class="verse">They could possibly have dreamed of.</div>
<div class="verse">Giving one such strange expressions—</div>
<div class="verse">Sullen, stupid, pert expressions.</div>
<div class="verse">Really any one would take us</div>
<div class="verse">(Any one that did not know us)</div>
<div class="verse">For the most unpleasant people!”</div>
<div class="verse">(Hiawatha seemed to think so,</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed to think it not unlikely).</div>
<div class="verse">All together rang their voices,</div>
<div class="verse">Angry, loud, discordant voices,</div>
<div class="verse">As of dogs that howl in concert,</div>
<div class="verse">As of cats that wail in chorus.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">But my Hiawatha’s patience,</div>
<div class="verse">His politeness and his patience,</div>
<div class="verse">Unaccountably had vanished,</div>
<div class="verse">And he left that happy party.</div>
<div class="verse">Neither did he leave them slowly,</div>
<div class="verse">With the calm deliberation,</div>
<div class="verse">The intense deliberation</div>
<div class="verse">Of a photographic artist:</div>
<div class="verse">But he left them in a hurry,</div>
<div class="verse">Left them in a mighty hurry,</div>
<div class="verse">Stating that he would not stand it,</div>
<div class="verse">Stating in emphatic language</div>
<div class="verse">What he’d be before he’d stand it.</div>
<div class="verse">Thus departed Hiawatha.</div>

death hallows him anew to us; as if life were not sacred too,—as
if it were comparatively a light thing to fail in love and
reverence to the brother who has to climb the whole toilsome
steep with us, and all our tears and tenderness were due to the
one who is spared that hard journey.</p>

<p>Although this gross and inconceivable falsity will hardly be

so utterly lost but that they receive, and know that they receive,
at certain moments, strength of some kind, or rebuke from the
appealings of outward things; and that it is not possible for a
Christian man to walk across so much as a rood of the natural
earth, with mind unagitated and rightly poised, without receiving
strength and hope from stone, flower, leaf or sound, nor without
a sense of a dew falling upon him out of the sky; though I
say this falsity is not wholly and in terms admitted, yet it
seems to be partly and practically so in much of the doing and
teaching even of holy men, who in the recommending of the love
of God to us, refer but seldom to those things in which it is most
abundantly and immediately shown; though they insist much on
his giving of bread, and raiment, and health (which he gives to
all inferior creatures), they require us not to thank him for that
glory of his works which he has permitted us alone to perceive:
they tell us often to meditate in the closet, but they send us not,
like Isaac, into the fields at even; they dwell on the duty of
self-denial, but they exhibit not the <i>duty of delight</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Robert Browning</span> (<i>Rabbi ben Ezra</i>).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="notes">

<p>“All (that) I could never be, All (that) man ignored in me.” All
that the world could not know, a man’s thoughts, desires, and intentions,
all that he wished or tried to be or do, although unknown to his fellows,
have their value in God’s eyes. Man is the Cup, whose shape (i.e., character)
has been formed by the wheel of the great Potter, God. See further as to
this Eastern metaphor.</p>

<p>The late Mrs. A. W. Verrall, widow of Doctor Verrall and herself a
brilliant scholar, pointed out in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the Society for Psychical
Research, June, 1911, a probable connection between “Rabbi ben Ezra,”
and “Omar Khayyam,” and I do not think that her interesting views
have been published elsewhere.</p>

<p>Both poems centre round the idea of man as a Cup, but treat the metaphor
from very different standpoints. Omar’s cup (quoting from the first
edition) is to be filled with “Life’s Liquor” (ii), with “Wine! <i>Red</i> Wine!”
(vi), with what “clears To-Day of past regrets” (xx); the object is to drown
the memory of the fact that “without asking” we are “hurried hither”
and “hurried hence” (xxx); the “Ruby Vintage” is to be drunk “with
old Khayyam,” and “when the Angel with his darker Draught draws
up” to us we are to take that draught without shrinking (xlviii). On the
other hand Rabbi ben Ezra’s Cup is to be used by the great Potter. We
are told to look “not down but up! to uses of a cup” (30). The Rabbi
asks “God who mouldest men ... to take and use His work” (32) and
the ultimate purpose of the Cup, when it has been made “perfect as planned,”
is to slake the thirst of the Master.</p>

<p>The comparison of man to the Clay of the Potter in both poems is
not sufficient in itself to show any connection between them. Such a
comparison is found, as Fitzgerald reminds us, “in the Literature of the
World from the Hebrew Prophets to the present time”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>; and it is as
appropriately employed by the Hebrew as by the Persian thinker. But
Mrs. Verrall has other grounds:</p>

<p>The little pamphlet in its brown wrapper containing the <i>Rubaiyat
of Omar Khayyam</i> was first published by Edward Fitzgerald in 1859, and,
as is well known, attracted so little attention that, although there were
only 250 copies, it found its way into the two-penny boxes of the book-sellers,
(It now sells for about £50!) But, nevertheless, the poem was
eagerly read and enthusiastically praised by a small group, among whom
were Swinburne and Rossetti. In 1861 Robert Browning came to live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
in London, and often saw Rossetti, who was his friend. It is, therefore,
very improbable that he did not learn of the poem, which had so impressed
Rossetti. In 1864 “Rabbi ben Ezra” was published in the volume
called <i>Dramatis Personae</i>.</p>

<p>Again, there is intrinsic evidence that Browning intended a direct
refutation of Omar’s theory of life. Compare verses 26 and 27 of “Rabbi
ben Ezra” with verses xxxvi and xxxvii of “Omar Khayyam” (first
edition).</p>

<p>Omar says that he “watched the Potter thumping his wet clay,”
and, thereupon advises:</p>

<p>Although the “carpe diem” (“seize to-day”) theory of life is no
doubt common to all literatures, the cumulative effect of Mrs. Verrall’s
argument is strong, although not conclusive.</p>

<p>He (Dr. Johnson) would not allow Scotland to derive any
credit from Lord Mansfield, for he was educated in England.
“Much,” said he, “may be made of a Scotchman, if he be caught
young.”</p>

<p>(A Mr. Strahan, a Scotchman, asked Dr. Johnson what he
thought of Scotland) “That it is a very vile country to be sure,
Sir,” returned for answer Dr. Johnson. “Well, Sir!” replied
the other, somewhat mortified, “God made it.” “Certainly
he did,” answered Mr. Johnson again, “but we must always
remember that <i>he made it for Scotchmen</i>.”</p>

<p>These are the two best of Johnson’s chaffing jibes against Scotchmen.
The neatness of the latter is, to my mind, spoilt by the words at the end,
which I have omitted: “and—comparisons are odious, Mr. Strahan,—but
God made hell.” The following may also be quoted as showing both
Johnson and that clever charlatan, Wilkes, quizzing Boswell (year 1781):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Wilkes</i>: “Pray, Boswell, how much may be got in a year by an
advocate at the Scotch bar?”</p>

<p><i>Boswell</i>: “I believe two thousand pounds.”</p>

<p><i>Wilkes</i>: “How can it be possible to spend that money in Scotland?”</p>

<p><i>Johnson</i>: “Why, Sir, the money may be spent in <i>England</i>;
but there is a harder question. If one man in Scotland gets possession of
two thousand pounds, what remains for all the rest of the nation?”</p>

<p>Many Scotchmen undoubtedly enjoy chaff against themselves and their
country, and I think this was so with Boswell. It is a phase of social
psychology that needs explaining.</p>

<p>In these jokes Johnson was, consciously or not, influenced by the fine
Royalist poet, John Cleveland (1613-1658); but the latter was very much
in earnest. He detested the Scotch for fighting against Charles I. His
references to Scotland in <i>The Rebel Scot</i> are wonderfully clever:—</p>

<p>God is present by His essence; which, because it is infinite,
cannot be contained within the limits of any place; and because
He is of an essential purity and spiritual nature, He cannot
be undervalued by being supposed present in the places of
unnatural uncleanness: because, as the sun, reflecting upon the
mud of strands and shores, is unpolluted in its beams, so is God
not dishonoured when we suppose Him in every one of His
creatures, and in every part of every one of them.</p>

<p>I dare say Alexander the Great was somewhat staggered in
his plans of conquest by Parmenio’s way of putting things.
“After you have conquered Persia what will you do?” “Then
I shall conquer India.” “After you have conquered India,
what will you do?” “Conquer Scythia.” “And after you have
conquered Scythia, what will you do?” “Sit down and rest.”
“Well,” said Parmenio to the conqueror, “why not sit down
and rest now?”</p>

Myers’ experience. It was published in 1882, but written about ten
years before. He had then lost his faith in Christianity, but believed in
a future life on grounds based partly upon philosophy and partly on

Wordsworth, Vaughan, and many others believe that we had a

<p>My closing remark is as to avoiding debates that are in their
very nature interminable.... There is a certain intensity of
emotion, interest, bias or prejudice if you will, that can neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
reason nor be reasoned with. On the purely intellectual side,
the disqualifying circumstances are complexity and vagueness.
If a topic necessarily hauls in numerous other topics of difficulty,
the essay may do something for it, but not the debate. Worst
of all is the presence of several large, ill-defined, and unsettled
terms. A not unfrequent case is a combination of the several
defects, each, perhaps, in a small degree. A tinge of predilection
or party, a double or triple complication of doctrines, and one
or two hazy terms will make a debate that is pretty sure to end
as it began. Thus it is that a question, plausible to appearance,
may contain within it capacities of misunderstanding, cross-purposes,
and pointless issues, sufficient to occupy the long
night of Pandemonium, or beguile the journey to the nearest
fixed star.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I gave you at any time the details of
my work here, or the principles upon which I have been proceeding....
Some of the work set down includes Ancient Ethics—which
is almost entirely grossly wrong and great rubbish also.
This part I have persistently refused to get up, not because I
disliked it, but because it is decidedly injurious to warp and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
twist the brain by impressing it with wrong thoughts and systems—just
as it would be insane in the polisher of a mirror to think it
would reflect the external world more truly, if he gave it a dint
here, a scratch there, a bulge in another place, and so forth.
It would take me too long to describe the details. Suffice it to
say that one of the examiners in Mental Philosophy and in Moral
and Political Philosophy is an old, <i>blind</i> (literally) man of the old
school, who gave a very abnormally large amount of questions
relating to Ancient Ethics, and an abnormally large amount
to the <i>early</i> part of English Ethics—leaving hardly any marks
to be scored by thorough understanding and ability to use the
principles of the subjects.</p>

<p>The consequence was that those, who had crammed up the
earlier text-books and could reproduce them, had an enormous
advantage. This old fogey moreover is strongly anti-Spencerian.
Indeed I heard that he had objected to my answers because
“there was too much of Spencer and myself!” So that instead
of <i>criticism and originality</i>, he avowedly preferred <i>mere reproduction</i>,
a good example of the slavishness of that method of
examination predominant mostly, which, as Spencer wrote
to me some time ago, is devised for testing a man’s “power
of acquisition instead of using that which has been acquired.”</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Richard Hodgson</span> (1855-1905) (<i>Letter, Dec., 1881</i>).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>This letter was written to me from Cambridge, when Hodgson (<a href="#PREFACE">see
Preface</a>) had found his immediate prospects blasted by the results of the
Moral Science Tripos. No one was placed in the First Class and he
(although at the head of the Tripos) only in the Second Class. This meant
that he had no hope of a Fellowship, which would have enabled him to go
on with original work in philosophy, and he would have to employ his
time in earning a livelihood. Added to this was the cruel disappointment
to his family and friends.</p>

<p>Hodgson was one of the most gifted men that Australia has produced.
He had completed his M.A. and LL.D. courses in Melbourne by 1877,
when he was twenty-two years of age, and then, discarding the profession
of the law, left for Cambridge to read Mental and Moral Science. While
still an undergraduate there he had written an article in reply to T. H.
Green, and submitted it to Herbert Spencer, who highly approved of it,
and sent it to the <i>Contemporary</i>. However, as stated above, Hodgson’s
immediate future depended on the result of the examination. (He was at
the time preparing one of the articles he contributed to <i>Mind</i>, and had in
view further original work.)</p>

<p>When the result of the Tripos appeared, Henry Sidgwick and Venn
who were then Lecturers and by far the best Moral Science men in Cambridge,
came to sympathize with Hodgson, on the unfair result. They
urged him to go to Germany so that he might acquire that perfect
command of the German language which was necessary for his philosophic
work. On learning that he was not in a position to do this, Sidgwick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
insisted—as he said, “in the interests of philosophy”—on defraying <i>the
whole of the expenses</i> of Hodgson’s residence in Germany. As he insisted
strongly, Hodgson accepted the offer, and went to Jena, armed with a very
flattering letter of introduction from Herbert Spencer to Haeckel.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after his return from Germany the Society for
Psychical Research was founded, and Hodgson joined it. He came to the
conclusion that the work of this Society was more important than any
other study, while probably it would also be of fundamental assistance
to philosophy. He went out to India in 1884, and thoroughly exposed
Madame Blavatsky and her “Theosophy,” and, from about 1886, devoted
the rest of his life to Psychical Research. Although maintaining his
reading and his intimacy with Henry Sidgwick, William James, and others,
his services practically became lost to philosophy. This, however, does
not affect the important fact illustrated by the Tripos incident. We
learn what ineptitude can exist in a great university, and what grave results
must necessarily follow therefrom.</p>

<p>Although Hodgson was writing under stress of a grievous calamity
(yet with a dauntless heart—see verse on Dedication page), his remarks
on Ancient Ethics are not, in my opinion, exaggerated.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer’s remark to Hodgson about examinations may also
be noted.</p>

<p>In Shelley’s great poem, Prometheus is not merely the Titan who,
having stolen fire from heaven to benefit man, was chained to a pillar while
an eagle tore at his vitals, he is the spirit of humanity. Man has (through
superstition) given the god, Zeus, great powers which he uses to enslave
and oppress man’s own mind and body. Ultimately the god is overthrown,
Prometheus, the spirit of man, is released, and the world enters upon its
progress towards perfection.</p>

<p>There is little merit in inventing a happy idea, or attractive
situation, so long as it is only the author’s voice which we hear.
As a being whom we have called into life by magic arts, as soon
as it has received existence, acts independently of the master’s
impulse, so the poet creates his persons, and then watches and
relates what they do and say. Such creation is poetry in the
literal sense of the term, and its possibility is an unfathomable
enigma. The gushing fullness of speech belongs to the poet,
and it flows from the lips of each of his magic beings in the
thoughts and words peculiar to its nature.</p>

<p>Poetry is not like reasoning, a power to be exerted according
to the determination of the will. A man cannot say, “I will
compose poetry.” The greatest poet even cannot say it; for
the mind in creation is as a fading coal, which some invisible
influence, like an inconstant wind, awakens to transitory brightness;
this power arises from within, like the colour of a flower
which fades and changes as it is developed, and the conscious
portions of our nature are unprophetic either of its approach or its
departure. Could this influence be durable in its original
purity and force, it is impossible to predict the greatness of the
results; but, when composition begins, inspiration is already
on the decline, and the most glorious poetry that has ever been
communicated to the world is probably a feeble shadow of the
original conceptions of the poet.</p>

<p>She (the ship of Odysseus) came to the limits of the world,
to the deep flowing Oceanus. There is the land and the city
of the Cimmerians, shrouded in mist and cloud, and never does
the shining sun look down on them with his rays, neither when he
climbs up the starry heavens, nor when again he turns earthward
from the firmament, but deadly night is outspread over miserable
mortals. Thither we came and ran the ship ashore and took
out the sheep; but for our part we held on our way along the
stream of Oceanus, till we came to the place which Circe had
declared to us.</p>

<p>There Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims, but I drew
my sharp sword from my thigh, and dug a pit, as it were a cubit
in length and breadth, and about it poured a drink-offering
to all the dead, first with mead and thereafter with sweet wine
and for the third time with water.... When I had besought
the tribes of the dead with vows and prayers, I took the sheep and
cut their throats over the trench, and the dark blood flowed forth,
and lo, the spirits of the dead that be departed gathered them
from out of Erebus. Brides and youths unwed, and old men
of many and evil days, and tender maidens with griefs yet fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
at heart; and many there were, wounded with bronze-shod
spears, men slain in fight with their bloody mail about them.
And these many ghosts flocked together from every side about
the trench with a wondrous cry, and pale fear gat hold on me....
I drew the sharp sword from my thigh and sat there, suffering
not the strengthless heads of the dead to draw nigh to the blood,
ere I had word of Teiresias....</p>

<p>Anon came up the soul of my mother dead, Anticleia, the
daughter of Autolycus, the great-hearted, whom I left alive
when I departed for sacred Ilios. At the sight of her I wept,
and was moved with compassion, yet even so, for all my sore
grief, I suffered her not to draw nigh to the blood, ere I had
word of Teiresias.</p>

<p>Anon came the soul of Theban Teiresias, with a golden sceptre
in his hand, and he knew me and spake unto me: “Son of Laertes
of the seed of Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, what seekest
thou <i>now</i>, wretched man—wherefore hast thou left the sunlight
and come hither to behold the dead and a land desolate of joy?
Nay, hold off from the ditch and draw back thy sharp sword,
that I may drink of the blood and tell thee sooth.” So spake he,
and I put up my silver-studded sword into the sheath, and
when he had drunk the dark blood, even then did the noble
seer speak unto me....</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Odyssey</span>, Bk. XI. (<i>Butcher &amp; Lang’s translation</i>).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>In this weird scene Odysseus is summoning the shade of Teiresias
from the under-world. He has with his sword to keep off the host of spirits,
including that of his own mother, whom the spilt blood has attracted—and
the hero is himself terrified at the awful spectacle.</p>

<p>What adds to the interest of such a passage is that to the ancient Greeks
this was no imaginary picture but a statement of actual facts. It will
be observed that the dead live in a dark land, “desolate of joy.”</p>

<p>It is hardly possible for a younger generation to realize the almost
intoxicating effect produced upon us by Swinburne’s new melodies.
Although the <i>Poems and Ballads</i> were largely erotic, the curious fact is
that we were too much carried away by the beauty and swing of his verse
to trouble about the sensual element in it. That element was in itself an
<i>artificial</i> production and not a reflection of the poet’s own emotions, for
he was free from sensuality. It was with us more a question of <i>music</i>.
Swinburne himself preferred a musical word or line to one that would more
aptly express his meaning; and in the “Dedication,” from which the
above verses are quoted, several lines will not bear analysis. However,
this was one of our favourites among his poems.</p>

<p>As might be expected Swinburne was much parodied (and indeed in
the <i>Heptalogia</i> and in the poems lately published he parodied himself).
The above poem has been cleverly parodied by a lawyer, Sir Frederick
Pollock. (Although parodies go as far back as the Fifth Century B.C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
I know of no other lawyer who, <i>qua</i> lawyer, has successfully taken a hand
in the game.) In his parody Pollock’s subject was the great changes effected
by the Judicature Act, when the old Courts of Common Law, Chancery,
and others were consolidated into one Supreme Court, and the various
classes of business assigned to different “Divisions.” Also owing to changes
in procedure, much of the old technical learning became obsolete. His
last verse is as follows (compare with the second verse quoted above):</p>

<p>Wulf died, as he had lived, a heathen. Placidia, who loved
him well, as she loved all righteous and noble souls, had succeeded
once in persuading him to accept baptism. Adolf himself
acted as one of his sponsors; and the old warrior was in the act
of stepping into the font, when he turned suddenly to the bishop
and asked, ‘Where were the souls of his heathen ancestors?’
“In hell,” replied the worthy prelate. Wulf drew back from
the font, and threw his bearskin cloak around him—“He would
prefer, if Adolf had no objection, to go to his own people.” And
so he died unbaptized, and went to his own place.</p>

<p>The lady prefers Duty to Love, but she will remain constant to her
lover, and reunion with him in heaven will make amends for all. (In the
remainder of the poem Browning puts the case of the lover who, although
deserted, is expected to remain constant through life—and who falls. The
lady had disobeyed Love, because of the hardship and trouble that would
follow, and Browning, whose own married life had been a most happy one,
says this was no excuse.)</p>

<p>Cunning, being the ape of wisdom, is the most distant from

cunning is only the want of understanding, which, because it
cannot compass its ends by direct ways, would do it by a trick
and circumvention.</p>

Whereas the feeblest works in the literature of power (poetry

survive as finished and unalterable amongst men.... The
Iliad, the Prometheus of Æschylus—the Othello or King Lear—the

<div class="notes">

<p>In my notes, this strange poem is stated to have been actually written
by Smith on the night before his wedding; but it is difficult to believe
this. In the poem, the poet sits until dawn on his wedding-eve thinking
of the “long-lost passions of his youth,” and comparing them with his
calm and unimpassioned love, “pale blossom of the snow,” for the bride
of the morrow. He even fears that his wife’s tenderness will keep alive
the memories of his youthful loves:</p>

<div class="verse">It may be that your loving wiles</div>

<div class="verse">It may be that my sleeping breath</div>

<div class="verse">And, in the awful trance of death,</div>
<div class="verse">A stranger’s name be on my tongue.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is sufficiently gruesome. However he finally comes to the conclusion
(although it seems dragged in to save a very difficult situation) that his
love for his future bride may become more satisfactory to him:</p>

<p>Smith, with P. J. Bailey, Sydney Dobell and others, belonged to what
was called the “Spasmodic” school which the <i>Britannica</i> says is “now
fallen into oblivion.” I do not know what this means. Smith, Bailey,
and Dobell no doubt wrote extravagantly, but they have all written good
verses. Take for example the following from Smith’s first poem, “<i>A
Life Drama</i>,” written at twenty-two years of age:</p>

<p>This is not one of Browning’s best poems, but it is interesting. The
butterfly in the air over the poet swimming is compared to a ‘certain soul,’
Mrs. Browning, looking down upon him from heaven. The ‘flying,’ free
and entirely released from the earth, is the life of the soul, to which the
poet cannot attain; but during periods of inspiration he lives a life free
of ‘worldly noise and dust,’ which approaches that of the soul. Such
periods of inspiration are likened to ‘swimming’ with the land always
in sight, as compared with the ‘flying’ of the soul in the far-removed
celestial regions. “We substitute, in a fashion, For heaven—poetry.”</p>

<p><i>Whatever they are we seem</i>: during inspiration the poet’s life is a reflex
of or approach to the heavenly life.</p>

<p><i>Amphibian</i>, because the poet is of earth and yet can “swim” in the
sea of imagination. Charles Lamb speaks of his charming Child Angel,
half-angel, half-human, as Amphibium. Browning’s poem may have been
an unconscious development of a passage from Sir Thomas Browne’s
<i>Religio Medici</i>:—“Thus is Man that great and true <i>Amphibium</i>, whose
nature is disposed to live, not only like other creatures in divers elements,
but in divided and distinguished worlds: for though there be but one to
sense, there are two to reason, the one visible, the other invisible.”</p>

<p>The sixth and last verses are interesting. Browning, while in the
world “Both lives and likes life’s way,” nor is anxious that his “wings”
should be “unfurled”; and he wonders how his angel-wife regards him,
content with his “mimic flight.”—<a href="#Page_114">See p. 114.</a></p>

<p>The Quakers have contracted themselves too much by leaving
the works of God out of their system. Though I reverence their
philanthropy, I can not help smiling at the conceit, that, if the
taste of a Quaker could have been consulted at the creation,
what a silent and drab-coloured creation it would have been!
Not a flower would have blossomed its gaieties, nor a bird been
permitted to sing.</p>

<p>This quotation reminds me of an interesting passage in Professor
Bateson’s Presidential Address to the British Association at Melbourne
in 1914. Although it has not a very close connection with the quotation
the reader will not object to my giving it a place here:—</p>

<p>“Everyone must have a preliminary sympathy with the aims of
eugenists both abroad and at home. Their efforts at the least are doing
something to discover and spread truth as to the physiological structure
of society. The spread of such organizations, however, almost of necessity
suffers from a bias towards the accepted and the ordinary, and if they
had power it would go hard with many ingredients of society that could
be ill-spared. I notice an ominous passage in which even Galton, the
founder of eugenics, feeling perhaps some twinge of his Quaker ancestry,
remarks that ‘as the Bohemianism in the nature of our race is destined to
perish, the sooner it goes, the happier for mankind.’ It is not the eugenists
who will give us what Plato has called ‘divine releases from the common
ways.’ If some fancier with the catholicity of Shakespeare would take
us in hand, well and good; but I would not trust Shakespeares, <i>meeting
as a committee</i>. Let us remember that Beethoven’s father was an habitual
drunkard and that his mother died of consumption. From the genealogy
of the patriarchs also we learn—what may very well be the truth—that
the fathers of such as dwell in tents, and of all such as handle the harp
or organ, and the instructor of every artificer in brass or iron—the founders,
that is to say, of the arts and the sciences—came in direct descent from Cain,
and not in the posterity of the irreproachable Seth, who is to us, as he
probably was also in the narrow circle of his own contemporaries, what
naturalists call a <i>nomen nudum</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Nomen nudum</i> is a bare name without further particulars, but Donne,
no doubt on the authority of Josephus (I. 2.3), attributes Astronomy to
Seth (“The Progresse of the Soule”):—</p>

</div>

<p>Donne (1573-1631) is “vext” with Astronomy, presumably because
at that time Kepler (1571-1630) and Galileo (1564-1642) were affirming the
Copernican system and making other discoveries supposed to be dangerous
to religion.</p>

<p>“Two Voices are there; one is of the sea,” is Wordsworth’s fine
sonnet on the subjugation of Switzerland.</p>

<p>It is certainly extraordinary how the great poet at times dropped
into the most prosaic language and commonplace verse. This, however,
was only in his earlier poems and only in a few of those poems. His theory
at that time was that poetic language should be natural, such as used by
ordinary men, and not essentially different from prose. Actually, however,
at the root of the matter was his want of any sense of humour. Only so
can we account for his beginning a poem “Spade! with which Wilkinson
hath tilled his lands,” or writing absurdly babyish verses. The one instance
on record in which he did apparently exhibit a grotesque kind of humour
was in a verse of <i>Peter Bell</i>:—</p>

<div class="verse indent7">Is it a party in a parlour?</div>
<div class="verse">Cramm’d just as they on earth were cramm’d—</div>

<div class="verse">But, as you by their faces see,</div>
<div class="verse">All silent and all damn’d.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But this he no doubt wrote quite seriously and without any idea that the
verse was humorous. Shelley placed this verse at the head of his parody
of <i>Peter Bell</i>, and Wordsworth omitted it from the poem after 1819.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, true that no one at any time longs for death; and
that our desire is for “more life <i>and fuller</i>.” But men have for various
reasons longed <i>to die</i>, though they may not have longed for <i>death</i>. There
are those to whom the remainder of life will be one torment of pain to themselves
and a continuous mental distress to their friends; and there have
been men of firm religious belief who desired to pass into a nobler <i>life</i>
beyond the grave. Again, Richard Hodgson definitely assured me in
1897 that he <i>wished to die</i>. He was absolutely satisfied with the evidence
of survival after death, which he had had in connection with the Society
for Psychical Research; and his desire was to “pass over” and be with
the friends with whom for years he had been in communication. Hodgson
was incapable of saying anything insincere.</p>

<p>Not the truth of which a man is or believes himself to be possessed,
but the earnest efforts which he has made to attain truth,
make the worth of the man. For it is not through the possession
of, but through the search for truth, that he develops those
powers in which alone consists his ever-growing perfection.
Possession makes the mind stagnant, indolent, proud.</p>

<p>If God held in His right hand all truth, and in His left the ever-living
desire for truth—although with the condition that I should
remain in error for ever—and if He said to me “Choose,” I should
humbly bow before His left hand, and say “Father, give; pure
truth is for Thee alone.”</p>

<p>When Lessing wrote this famous passage he was contending that
criticism should be absolutely free in regard to religious, as to all other,
subjects. “The argument on which he chiefly relies is that the Bible
cannot be considered necessary to a belief in Christianity, since Christianity
was a living and conquering power before the New Testament in its present
form was recognised by the church. The true evidence for what is essential
in Christianity, he contends, is its adaptation to the wants of human
nature; hence the religious spirit is undisturbed by the speculations of the
boldest thinkers.” (<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>).</p>

<p>Human life may be painted according to two methods. There
is the stage method. According to that, each character is duly
marshalled at first, and ticketed; we know with an immutable
certainty that, at the right crises, each one will reappear and act
his part, and, when the curtain falls, all will stand before it
bowing. There is a sense of satisfaction in this—and of completeness.
But there is another method—the method of the life
we all lead. Here nothing can be prophesied. There is a strange
coming and going of feet. Men appear, act and re-act upon each
other, and pass away. When the crisis comes, the man who
would fit it does not return. When the curtain falls, no one is
ready. When the footlights are brightest they are blown out;
and what the name of the play is no one knows. If there sits
a spectator who knows, he sits so high that the players in the
gaslight cannot hear his breathing.</p>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">J. Blanco White</span> (1775-1841).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="notes">

<p>(<a href="#PREFACE">See preface.</a>) This sonnet, apart from its great excellence, is a remarkable
literary curiosity. By this one poem alone Blanco White achieved
a lasting reputation as a poet. The point is that this is <i>his only
poem</i>. He certainly had previously written a sonnet of little merit
on survival after death, but “<i>Night and Death</i>” was apparently an
inspired transfiguration of his earlier effort. It is a startling instance of
inspiration coming to a man once only in his life—and then coming
in its very highest form. There are other poets, whose work is generally
of poor quality, but who have each produced one surprisingly good poem
which alone keeps their memory alive. An instance of this is Christopher
Smart (1722-1771), who wrote several volumes of verse but only one fine
poem, the “Song of David.” Charles Wolfe (1791-1823) is also known
only by his “Burial of Sir John Moore,” but his other poems, though
forgotten, are said to have had some merit.</p>

<p>The sonnet is also interesting for another reason. White’s family
had settled in Spain for two generations, his grandfather having changed
his name to Blanco. His mother was Spanish, he was educated in Spain,
and became a Spanish priest, and he did not leave for England until 1810,
when thirty-five years of age. Yet White’s beautiful thought could hardly
be expressed in finer language. There is, however, one defect in the words
“fly and leaf and insect.” (William Sharp courageously altered “fly”
into “flower.”)</p>

<p>Coleridge thought this “the finest and most grandly conceived sonnet
in our language.” Leigh Hunt said that in point of thought it “stands
supreme, perhaps, above all in any language: nor can we ponder it too
deeply, or with too hopeful a reverence.”</p>

and wisdom, in the whole creation, and in God Himself. And he,
that hath so many causes of joy, and so great, is very much in love
with sorrow and peevishness, who loses all these pleasures, and
chooses to sit down upon his little handful of thorns.</p>

<p>For my own part, I could not look but with wonder and respect
on the Chinese. Their forefathers watched the stars before mine
had begun to keep pigs. Gunpowder and printing, which the
other day we imitated, and a school of manners which we never
had the delicacy so much as to desire to imitate, were theirs in a
long-past antiquity. They walk the earth with us, but it seems
they must be of different clay. They hear the clock strike the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
same hour, yet surely of a different epoch. They travel by steam
conveyance, yet with such baggage of old Asiatic thoughts and
superstitions as might check the locomotive in its course. Whatever
is thought within the circuit of the Great Wall; what the
wry-eyed, spectacled schoolmaster teaches in the hamlets round
Pekin; religions so old that our language looks a halfling boy
alongside; philosophy so wise that our best philosophers find
things therein to wonder at; all this travelled alongside of me
for thousands of miles over plain and mountain. Heaven
knows if we had one common thought or fancy all that way,
or whether our eyes, which yet were formed upon the same
design, beheld the same world out of the railway windows. And
when either of us turned his thoughts to home and childhood,
what a strange dissimilarity must there not have been in these
pictures of the mind—when I beheld that old, gray, castled city,
high throned above the firth, with the flag of Britain flying, and
the red-coat sentry pacing over all; and the man in the next car
to me would conjure up some junks and a pagoda and a fort
of porcelain, and call it, with the same affection, home.</p>

<p>The Cynic in society becomes the Pessimist in religion. The
large embrace of sympathy, which fails him as interpreter of human
life, will no less be wanting when he reads the meaning of the
universe. The harmony of the great whole escapes him in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
hunt for little discords here and there. He is blind to the
august balance of nature, in his preoccupation with some
creaking show of defect. He misses the comprehensive march
of advancing purpose, because while he himself is in it, he has
found some halting member that seems to lag behind. He picks
holes in the universal order; he winds through its tracks as a
detective, and makes scandals of all that is not to his mind;
trusts nothing that he cannot see: and he sees chiefly the exceptional,
the dubious, the harsh. The glory of the midnight
heavens affects him not, for thinking of a shattered planet or
the uninhabitable moon. He makes more of the flood which
sweeps the crop away, than of the perpetual river that feeds
it year by year. For him the purple bloom upon the hills, peering
through the young green woods, does but dress up a stony
desert with deceitful beauty; and in the new birth of summer,
he cannot yield himself to the exuberance of glad existence for
wonder why insects tease and nettles sting. Nothing is so fair,
nothing so imposing, as to beguile him into faith and hope....
In selfish minds the same temper resorts to the pettiest reasons
for the most desolating thoughts: “If God were good, why
should I be born with a club-foot? If the world were justly
governed how could my merits be so long overlooked?”</p>

<p>In proportion as a man has anything in him divine, the firmament
flows before him and takes his signet and form. Not
he is great who can alter matter, but he who can alter my state
of mind. They are the kings of the world who give the colour of
their present thought to all nature and all art.... The great
man makes the great thing.... Linnæus makes botany the most
alluring of studies, and wins it from the farmer and the herb-woman;
Davy, chemistry; and Cuvier, fossils. The day is always
his, who works in it with serenity and great aims. The unstable

<p>The globe has been circumnavigated, but no man ever yet has;
you may survey a kingdom and note the result in maps, but all
the <i>savants</i> in the world could not produce a reliable map of the
poorest human personality. And the worst of all this is, that love
and friendship may be the outcome of a certain condition of knowledge;
increase the knowledge, and love and friendship beat their
wings and go. Every man’s road in life is marked by the graves
of his personal likings. Intimacy is frequently the road to
indifference; and marriage a parricide.</p>

<p>This fine poem is one of a series called “Switzerland,” which was
written as the result of Arnold’s meeting and falling in love with a lady at
Berne. The poem immediately preceding it in the series is entitled “Isolation:
To Marguerite,” while this is called “To Marguerite, Continued”
but as it is now quoted separately, it is better entitled “Isolation.”</p>

<p>In the preceding poems the lady has lost her affection while her lover
is still devoted; and this leads to the subject of our isolation from each other
in our inner lives. In the second verse the poet describes the moments
when we most crave for love, sympathy, and mutual spiritual understanding
and union.</p>

<p>For an interesting fact connected with this poem, see next quotation
and note.</p>

<p>(Thackeray has been describing how husband, wife, mother,
son—each of the inmates of a household—is interested in his
or her own separate world and looking at the same things from
a different point of view.) How lonely we are in the world!
You and your wife have pressed the same pillow for forty years
and fancy yourselves united: pshaw! does she cry out when
you have the gout, or do you lie awake when she has the tooth-ache?...
As for your wife—O philosophic reader, answer
and say, Do you tell <i>her</i> all? Ah, sir, a distinct universe walks
about under your hat and under mine—all things in nature
are different to each—the woman we look at has not the same
features, the dish we eat from has not the same taste to the one
and the other—you and I are but a pair of infinite isolations, with
some fellow-islands a little more or less near to us.</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Thackeray</span> (<i>Pendennis</i>, ch. XVI).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>The similarity between this passage and the preceding poem, written
at about the same time, is very curious. Arnold’s poem appeared in 1852
but was composed ten years earlier, while <i>Pendennis</i> was published in
monthly parts in 1849-50. Therefore, neither author would consciously
know at the time what the other had written.</p>

<p>The incident is probably an illustration of the mysterious way in
which minds influence one another and create the spirit of the particular
age. There is, I believe, a Chinese proverb to the effect that we are more
the product of our age than of our parents. This permeating quality of
thought and feeling is, no doubt, the explanation why the highest art and
literature, though often unappreciated at the time, become ultimately
recognized. It appears not to be sufficiently taken into account in other
directions. For instance, it is repeatedly stated that Blake, because of
the limited circulation of his poems, exercised <i>no</i> influence on the Romantic
Revival—see for example <i>The Cambridge History of English Literature</i>,
Vol. XI, 201. Yet we know that his work was known to and appreciated
by Wordsworth, Coleridge, Lamb, Southey, and Hayley. (Although little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
regarded now, Hayley’s fame was then so great that he was offered and
refused the poet-laureateship. He appears to be the one man who was an
intimate friend of both Blake and Cowper.) While a very long period
went by before Blake’s poems became generally known, their influence
may well have been very great, permeating unconsciously through other
minds. <a href="#Page_194">See reference on p. 194</a> to the similar case of Fitzgerald’s “Omar
Khayyam.”</p>

<p>Even if a poem were read by <i>only one person</i>, it might conceivably
influence a generation of authors. Suppose, if that had been possible, a
page of Swinburne’s “Tristram of Lyonesse” or F. W. H. Myers’ “Implicit
Promise” (both quoted elsewhere) had been read by Pope or Dryden;
how the monotonous heroic couplet of their time might have been transformed!</p>

<p>Humanity is neither a love for the whole human race, nor a love
for each individual of it, but a love for the race, or for the ideal
of man, in each individual. In other and less pedantic words,
he who is truly humane considers every human being <i>as such</i>
interesting and important, and without waiting to criticize each
individual specimen, pays in advance to all alike the tribute of
good wishes and sympathy.... If some human beings are
abject and contemptible, if it be incredible to us that they can
have any high dignity or destiny, do we regard them from so great
a height as Christ? Are we likely to be more pained by their
faults and deficiencies than he was? Is our standard higher than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>

of the race; no contempt for them did he ever express, no suspicion
that they might be less dear than the best and wisest to
the common Father, no doubt that they were naturally capable
of rising to a moral elevation like his own. There is nothing
of which a man may be prouder than of this; it is the most hopeful
and redeeming fact in history; it is precisely what was wanting
to raise the love of man as man to enthusiasm. An eternal glory
has been shed upon the human race by the love Christ bore to it.</p>

<p>So, then, as darkness had no beginning, neither will it ever
have an end. So, then, is it eternal. The negation of aught
else, is its affirmation. Where the light cannot come, there
abideth the darkness. The light doth but hollow a mine out of
the infinite extension of the darkness. And ever upon the steps
of the light treadeth the darkness; yea, springeth in fountains
and wells amidst it, from the secret channels of its mighty sea.
Truly, man is but a passing flame, moving unquietly amid
the surrounding rest of night; without which he yet could not
be, and whereof he is in part compounded.</p>

<p>It is a mistake into which spiritually-minded men have fallen,
that God is apprehended and known by a special faculty. The
fact is that every faculty is serviceable in this noble work.
We reach the Divine through our aesthetic faculties when our
soul is stirred by a grand burst of music, or by the contemplation
of a magnificent landscape. We reach the Divine through our
purely intellectual faculties, when, by true reasoning, founded
on sound observation, we master any great law by which
God governs the world. We reach the Divine through our
emotional nature when pure grief or pure love, holy longing,
unselfish hope, righteous indignation, elevate us above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
prosaic level of customary equanimity, and help us to realize
the incomparable beauty of holiness.</p>

<p>Just as the weeping Magdalene<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> stood bewailing the loss
of what even to her was only sacred clay, all unconscious that
her Saviour had been given back to her without seeing corruption,
in a glorified and eternal form, not dead, but alive for evermore,
whom she could love with ever increasing ardour of devotion:
so, we say, there are not a few in our time whose lot it is to wring
their hands over the grave of lost ideas, which they loved and their
fathers loved, but for which God himself is substituting ideas
nobler and better far, which earlier ages failed to grasp only
because they were not in circumstances to feel their higher worth.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>One cannot demonstrate on any physical or visible basis
whatever, that it is a nobler thing to suffer injustice than
to commit it, that truth-speaking is honourable, forgiveness of
injuries magnanimous, and loving self-sacrifice for others sublime.
Honour, purity, humility, reverence, tenderness, courtesy,
patience, these things cannot be weighed on physical scales,
cannot be handled or touched, or melted or frozen in any mechanical
or chemical laboratory. They belong to a different order
of realities from acids and vapours: they are denizens of what,
for want of any more definite or accurate expression, we are
accustomed to call the spiritual world.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>One can see how religion should, to a young person, be
associated with repressive and prohibitive laws. Youth is the
time for the luxuriating of newborn, and, therefore, delicious vital
forces. But its very luxuriance is disorderly, and religion cannot coexist
with disorder. Therefore, that which is so continually warning
the young against impulse, and passion, and irregularity, ought
not to be too greatly displeased if it should, by and by, come
to be regarded by the young as a synonym for mere repressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
force, and, therefore, as an unpleasant and unpopular thing.
I believe, too, that there is no exception to the uniformity of the
experience, that all young countries adopt freer systems of
religion, and divest religious bodies more completely of all political
and properly coercive power than older countries. It is all an
illustration of the same thing. Young life, which most needs
regulation, most dislikes it.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>As the genius of the bard is in the poem, as the wisdom of the

as the words of a man’s lips issue from the inner world of his
mental and spiritual character—so every work of God, and conspicuously
man, as the noblest of God’s works, may truly be said
to shadow forth a portion of the mind of God.</p>

<p>We talk of creation as a past thing. But the truth is, creation
is eternal. Creation never ceases. Every time the clouds
drop in rain, every time the waters freeze into new ice, every
time the juices of nature gather into another violet, every time
a new wail of life is heard upon a mother’s breast, every time you
breathe another sigh, or shed another tear, there is God as truly
present in His miraculous creative capacity as on the day when
He said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.</p>

<p>That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of frequency,

<p>In the story Dorothea has found her husband to be a man of narrow
mind and unsympathetic nature. Such a disillusionment after marriage
frequently happens, and we are not deeply moved by what is not unusual,
although it may mean a real life-tragedy. Ruskin says “God gives the
disposition to every healthy human mind in some degree to pass over or
even harden itself against evil things, else the suffering would be too great
to be borne” (<i>Modern Painters</i> v., xix., 32). Only thus could we have lived

<div class="notes">

<p>Abt—or Abbé—Georg Joseph Vogler, 1749-1814, a German organist
and composer, is probably chosen by Browning because, although an
important musician, his compositions have perished. In this fine poem
Vogler has been extemporizing, and his inspired music has lifted him in
ecstasy to heaven. The sounds are his slaves who have built palaces of
music, as in the Arab legends angels and demons built magic structures for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Solomon. He grieves that this wonderful music should apparently have
vanished for ever; but is comforted by the thought that no good thing,
no fine aspiration, no great effort or noble impulse can really die, but
must exist for ever in the mind of God.</p>

<p>If Browning had known the evidence now afforded scientifically by
hypnotism and otherwise, he might have come to the conclusion that all
our thoughts and feelings, <i>both good and bad</i>, are recorded deep down in
our own consciousness. Moreover, the existence of thought-transference
leads to the somewhat dreadful suggestion that this record of all our inmost
thoughts and feelings may possibly become open to the inspection of
every one.</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>See the preceding note. The poet says that Painting and Poetry are
“art in obedience to laws,” but the musician exerts a higher <i>creative</i> will
akin to that of God. The painter has before him the pictures he reproduces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the poet borrows his imagery from visible things and has apt words
in which to express his thoughts: the musician has nothing visible, nothing
outside his own soul, to assist him, and can use only the meaningless sounds
which we hear everywhere around us. By combining, however, three of
those empty sounds (in a chord) he evolves a fourth sound, which so transcends
all that other arts can do in expressing emotion that Browning
compares it to a “star.”</p>

<p>But this expresses only part of the poet’s meaning. In using this
tremendous comparison to a <i>star</i>, as also in enthroning music supreme
above art and poetry, he means that it transcends their loftiest flights and
rises <i>above our world</i> to the heavens above. In the earlier part of the poem
the “pinnacled glory” built by the slaves of sound at the bidding of the
musician’s soul is based “broad on the roots of things” and ascends until
it “attains to heaven.”</p>

<p>F. W. H. Myers, in “The Renewal of Youth,” has a passage on music.
His theme is that while music (as in Mozart’s operas) may express human
passion, it also (as in Beethoven) rises to greater heights and appears to
voice the emotions of a world beyond our senses. In the lines I have
italicized in the following passage he no doubt refers to Browning’s line,
“That out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star!”—the
“star” meaning that music ascends to a higher world than our own:—</p>

<p>Not only does Browning unselfishly assert that the sister-art
is superior to his own, but he goes further, and doubts if music is not the
greatest of all man’s gifts. I do not discuss either contention—leaving

<p>Evil of every kind, being familiar to us as an <i>object</i> of apprehension,
appears to be external to ourselves. And yet it is invested
with the greater part of its severity by the mind: it acts upon us
by the ideas it awakens, the affections it wounds, the aspirations
it disappoints. If its outward pressure were all, and it dealt
with us as beings of sense alone, it would lose most of its
poignancy and would dwindle down into a few animal pangs....
It is our higher nature that creates immeasurably the greater
part of the ills we endure: they are ideal, not sensible: and it
is the privilege of reason to have tears instead of groans; of love
to know grief instead of pain; of conscience to replace uneasiness
with remorse.... Penury, disgrace, bereavement,
guilt, are evils which we must be human in order to feel; and it
is the penalty of our nobleness, not only to be weighed down by
their occasional burthen, but to be perpetually haunted by the
phantom of their approach.</p>

<p>Two or three of them got round me, and begged me for the
twentieth time to tell them the name of my country. Then,
as they could not pronounce it satisfactorily, they insisted that
I was deceiving them, and that it was a name of my own invention.
One funny old man, who bore a ludicrous resemblance to a friend
of mine at home, was almost indignant. “Unglung!” said
he, “who ever heard of such a name?—anglang, angerlang—<i>that</i>
can’t be the name of your country; you are playing with us.”
Then he tried to give a convincing illustration. “My country
is Wanumbai—anybody can say Wanumbai. I’m an orang-Wanumbai;
but N-glung! who ever heard of such a name?
Do tell us the real name of your country, and when you are gone
we shall know how to talk about you.” To this luminous argument
and remonstrance I could oppose nothing but assertion, and the
whole party remained firmly convinced that I was for some
reason or other deceiving them.</p>

<p>If you examine the literature of the 17th and 18th centuries,
you will find that nearly all its expressions, having reference
to the country, show ... either a foolish sentimentality, or a
morbid fear, both of course coupled with the most curious ignorance.
Nothing is more remarkable than the general conception
of the country merely as a series of green fields, and the combined
ignorance and dread of more sublime scenery. The love of
fresh air and green grass forced itself upon the animal natures
of men; but that of the sublimer features of scenery had no
place in minds whose chief powers had been repressed by the
formalisms of the age. And although in the second-rate writers
continually, and in the first-rate ones occasionally, you find
an affectation of interest in mountains, clouds, and forests, yet
whenever they write from their heart, you will find an utter
absence of feeling respecting anything beyond gardens and
grass. Examine, for instance, the novels of Smollett, Fielding,
and Sterne, the comedies of Molière, and the writings of Johnson
and Addison, and I do not think you will find a single expression
of true delight in sublime nature in any one of them. Perhaps
Sterne’s <i>Sentimental Journey</i>, in its total absence of sentiment
on any subject but humanity, and its entire want of notice of
anything at Geneva which might not as well have been seen at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Coxwold, is the most striking instance I could give you; and if
you compare with this negation of feeling on one side, the interludes
of Molière, in which shepherds and shepherdesses are introduced
in court dress, you will have a very accurate conception
of the general spirit of the age.</p>

<div class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Shelley</span> (<i>Hellas</i>).</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="notes">

<p>It is very true that the amazing intellectual power of the Greeks
in a primitive age ensures them an immortality of fame; and this is finely
expressed <i>in the last two lines</i>. But those two splendid lines are utterly
spoilt by the two that precede them. One asks, Why “Greece <i>and</i> her foundations”?
One does not say “a house <i>and</i> its foundations” are built
somewhere or other. This by itself would be trivial, but next comes the
question, What is the meaning of the second line? We know what Shelley
intended—that the memory and influence of Greece will withstand its
destruction by war—but why in that case should she not be built <i>above</i>,
instead of submerged <i>below</i> the tide of war? Later on, in lines 836-7,
the Emperor Palæologus, at the siege of Constantinople, is said to have cast
himself “<i>beneath</i> the stream of war”; that is to say, he was overwhelmed
and killed. The words, in fact, do not express the poet’s meaning. The
third and fatal defect of the lines is the juxtaposition of “tide” and “sea”
—the city is <i>built below a tide</i>, and also <i>based on a sea</i>. Not only is this
combination absurd in itself, but it also destroys the beauty of the last
two magnificent lines. The moving unstable water is scarcely a foundation
to build upon, yet this meaning is forcibly impressed upon the word “sea”
by the previous mention of a “tide.” What Shelley meant was an immense
broad, deep, expanse of <i>solid crystal</i>—the “sea of glass like unto crystal”
of Revelations (iv, 6) and the <i>Mer de Glace</i> (“sea of ice”), the great Alpine
glacier.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Therefore, anyone who had exactness of thought or perception
of poetry would omit the first two lines and give only the last two as a
quotation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shelley in her note on “Hellas” specially refers to this verse
as a beautiful example of Shelley’s style, and she quotes <i>all four</i> lines.
We may assume, therefore, that Shelley himself thought highly of the verse,
and we thus have an illustration of the curious fact that a great poet is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
often a poor judge of his own poetry. (Almost certainly Shakespeare
himself did not realize how god-like he stood above all other poets.) However,
it is not only for this reason that I have included the above quotation,
but because with it I propose to make a flank attack upon Mr. R. W. Livingstone,
the author of <i>The Greek Genius and its Meaning to us</i>. I do this,
of course, with a special object in view.</p>

<p>Mr. Livingstone’s book is important, valuable, and highly interesting—and
is especially admirable because the author does not envelope his
subject in the usual glamour, born of enthusiasm. He is, indeed, most
exceptional in this respect, that he endeavours to look at the Greeks from
an ordinary commonsense point of view. But he makes the mistake,
not unusual with classical men, of supposing that he is a qualified critic
of poetry; and he, therefore, gives us a special dissertation upon the comparative
values of English and Greek poetry.</p>

<p>Apart from this dissertation, he quotes three or four passages from
English poets in the course of the book. Of these the most prominent
is the above verse of Shelley’s, and he quotes <i>all four</i> lines without comment.
Thus we see an able man, in whom classical study should have induced
exactness of thought, failing to analyse and understand what he is quoting.
But, more than this, the question is one of poetic perception. The imagery
in the last <i>two</i> lines is sublime—in the <i>four</i> lines it is ludicrous. Therefore,
we begin with the fact that our literary critic was unable to see palpable
and grave defects in one of the few verses he himself quotes. (I might give
other illustrations, as where he admires poor verse of Dryden’s, but I must
be brief.)</p>

<p>Mr. Livingstone’s point is that the “direct” and “truthful” character
of Greek poetry is superior to the “imaginative” quality of English
verse. He goes so far as to say that “Sappho and Simonides <i>with four
words</i> make him see a nightingale and give him a greater and far saner
pleasure” than Shelley’s poem “To a Skylark.” I take his quotation
from Simonides, as it involves less discussion than that from Sappho.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
It is (Fr, 73) ἀὴδονες πολυκώτιλοι χλωραύχενες εἰαριναί, “The warbling
nightingales with olive necks, the birds of spring.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Livingstone is not discussing beauty of expression we can leave
this out of consideration.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> He is discussing the <i>substance</i> of poetry, comparing
the “directness” and “truthfulness” of Simonides (in this case)
with the imaginative element in Shelley’s poem. He would apparently
discard the latter element altogether, and prefers a simple description
of the nightingale—that it sings, has an olive neck, and appears in spring.
The first suggestion that occurs to one is that if, say, an auctioneer’s catalogue
of farm stock—without any addition whatever to its contents—could be
worded prettily and made metrical, it would afford huge enjoyment to our
literary critic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole question is as to the value of the imaginative element which
to our minds makes Shelley’s poem one of the most beautiful lyrics—possibly
the most beautiful—in all literature. In sweeping away this element,
Mr. Livingstone tells us how much of English poetry must be cast aside.
But he does not realize that much else has also to be flung on the scrap-heap.
Imagination, in its true sense, includes all those aesthetic, moral, and spiritual
faculties which are higher than the intellect—all, in fact, that raises man above
his material existence. (See pp. <a href="#Page_39">39</a>, <a href="#Page_40">40</a>, <a href="#Page_358">358</a>.) With the immense deal of
English poetry which Mr. Livingstone proposes to “scrap” must go all
our most beautiful music, all that is great in painting (which is never “direct”
and “truthful” in this sense, or it would not be great), <i>all Greek statuary</i>,
and all that expresses high moral and spiritual truths in our literature. I do
not think that Mr. Livingstone will find many adherents to his new creed.</p>

<p>This critic also discusses <i>style</i>, and we find that he speaks of Pope
as a “great poet,” and apparently revels in his monotonous verse!
When pointing out that English verse, unlike what we have left of Greek
poetry, includes much unequal and ill-finished work, he says, “Of all our
great poets, perhaps only Milton and Pope can boast unfailing excellence
of style.”</p>

<p>As regards this inequality in the work of English poets the answer
is very simple. Mr. Livingstone forgets the fact—a very important fact
in any speculation upon the scheme of the universe—that only the good
things ultimately survive. How very little we have left of many Greek
poets! Of Sophocles only seven plays remain out of one hundred and
twenty-seven, <i>and the Fragments collected are said to be very poor</i> (many,
of course, are only grammatical illustrations)—and more than half of Homer
must have been dropped. We probably still have everything that is <i>best</i>
in Greek literature. Again, it is not in fact <i>desirable</i> to restrict publication
to work of the highest importance, and the facilities afforded by printing
have made it <i>unnecessary</i> thus to restrict it—so that even <i>My Commonplace
Book</i> is now, at least temporarily, part of English literature!</p>

<p>Greatly as I admire Mr. Livingstone’s book, I feel bound to call attention
to a view of poetry that must do great harm to University students
and others. I am also bound to mention him as an illustration of the fact
that classical men usually imagine that their study of the Greek and Latin
languages and literature qualifies them to become literary critics.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This
fact has impressed itself upon me from youth upwards. One of my teachers,
a man of some weight in the classical world, was in the habit of saying
that only through study of Latin and Greek could a man learn to write good
English!<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> His own English was simply execrable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>I will now give another instance where the classical enthusiast, as in
Mr. Livingstone’s case, tends to exaggerate the value of his favourite literature—truly
wonderful as it is. Gissing’s <i>Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft</i>
is an interesting book of wide circulation, in which the author displays
great admiration for and familiarity with the classics. Speaking of Xenophon’s
<i>Anabasis</i>, he says “Were it the sole book existing in Greek, it would
be abundantly worth while to learn the language in order to read it.” That
is to say, it would be worth while expending, out of our short lives, some
years of study for the sole purpose of reading in the original an extremely
<i>simple</i>, <i>prose</i> historical narrative, which has been excellently translated!
(If Gissing had said <i>Homer</i> instead of Xenophon, no one would have quarrelled
with him.) Again, he says, “Many a single line presents a picture which
deeply stirs the emotions”; and he gives us what he calls “a good instance
of such a line.” A guide, who has led the Greeks through hostile country,
has to return through the same perilous district, and the wonderful
line is Ἐπεὶ ἑσπέρα ἐγένετο, ᾤχετο τῆς νυκτὸς ἀπιών. This line Gissing
translates, “When evening came he took leave of us and went away by
night”—a sentence which only by inadvertence could have appeared in,
say, a <i>Times</i> leader, seeing that the words “by night” are redundant.
As a matter of fact, the translation is incorrect; there is nothing about
“taking leave of us,” and the meaning is, “As soon as evening came, he
had slipped away into the darkness.”</p>

<p>(Professor Naylor points out to me that the word ᾤχετο in this line is
interesting. It conveys the idea of a swift or abrupt departure or disappearance.
It is used in connection with that most interesting man Alcibiades
(Xen, <i>Hell.</i>, 2. I. 26) and gives a fine impression of his quick insolent temper.
The Greek admirals had put themselves in a position of extreme danger
and he came to warn them of their peril. Their reply was the usual expression
of ineptitude, “We are the admirals, not you”; and immediately
follows the one word ᾤχετο, “he turned on his heels and left”—and with
this word Alcibiades disappears from contemporary history.)</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>In referring to Mr. Livingstone’s remarks above I could not use the
Sappho quotation, because there are certain initial questions that need to
be first settled. (In briefly discussing these I must speak as though I were
expressing <i>definite opinions</i>, since otherwise the note could not be compressed
sufficiently, but I mean the following rather as <i>suggestions</i> which
may possibly be found useful.)</p>

<p>Sappho’s line is (Fr, 39) Ἦρος ἄγγελος ἱμερόφωνος ἀήδων, which Mr.
Livingstone translates “The messenger of spring, the lovely-voiced nightingale.”
Now ἱμερος (<i>himeros</i>) means animal passion, so that ἱμερόφωνος
(<i>himerophonos</i>) is a strong word meaning singing of, or with, passion—in
this case the passion of the pairing-time. Why then does Mr. Livingstone,
following Liddell and Scott, give the totally different meaning
“lovely-voiced”? Apparently it is because Theocritus (XXVIII, 7) applies
the expression “himerophonos” to the Charites, and, according to the
current conception, those deities were pure unimpassionate beings.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>In questions of this character, seeing that the Greek gods were guilty
of every form of immorality and the Greeks themselves were one of the most
sensual nations that ever existed, the presumption is in favour of impurity:
the onus of proof is on those who allege purity. I have not undertaken
the heavy work of looking up the innumerable references to the Charites
in Greek literature, but I know of nothing that supports the prevalent
conception of those deities. Apart from the fact that Theocritus uses the
word <i>himerophonos</i>, Meleager (Anth. Pal, V, 195) speaks of <i>himeros</i> as conferred
by the Charites. There is nothing in the meaning of <i>charis</i>, or the
verb <i>charizesthai</i> to support the current idea (both being even used in an
immodest sense); Homer identifies Charis with Aphrodite, with whom
Hesiod also identifies Aglaia, since each is made the wife of Hephaestus;
the Charites are constantly associated with Aphrodite and Erôs (and consequently
with Himeros, the personification of passion) so that the maxim
<i>Noscitur a sociis</i> applies; Sappho repeatedly claims them as her patrons;
as regards the representation of the Charites in art, girl friendship would
be a subject quite alien to the Greek mind.</p>

<p>If the view suggested is correct our authorities with their preconceived
ideas <i>presume to correct Theocritus and Sappho</i>! They not only
give a wrong view of the Charites, but also hide the coarseness of the compliment
paid by Theocritus to his lady friend—in each case <i>distorting
the truth</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Livingstone may have another reason for altering the meaning of
“himerophonos.” He appears to hold the opinion that a Greek writer
would not ascribe intelligence or emotion to a bird, as Mrs. Browning does in
“To a Seamew.” (I quite agree with him as to the false, feminine sentiment
in this poem. It is mainly the “Sonnets from the Portuguese” that raise
Mrs. Browning above the minor poets.) Mr. Livingstone, for example,
translates ἡμερόφων’ ἀλέκτωρ, “O cock that criest <i>at</i> dawn.” This should
surely mean “that announceth the dawn;” the attitude and the very <i>crow</i>
of the bird would suggest this to the Greeks; and the fowl did, as a matter
of fact, serve in place of an alarm-clock to them (see, for instance, Aristophanes’
<i>Birds</i>, 488). Does not Mr. Livingstone forget that the Greeks
attributed not only intelligence but also miraculous powers to animals (<a href="#Page_370">see p.
370</a>)? If so, this illustrates another fact noticeable among classical authorities.
They often fail to consider <i>all the premises</i> before arriving at a conclusion.
Taking another illustration from Mr. Livingstone, he says that the Greeks
had little of the feeling of wonder, did not “muse on the strangeness of the
world,” and would not have experienced the emotion Pascal felt when viewing
the starry heavens, “The eternal silence of those infinite spaces terrifies
me.” The premise he appears to omit here is the fact of the intense ignorance
of the Greeks. Their world was a very limited one, with its flat earth
and solid lid, certain bright objects conceived as gods or otherwise moving
in the intermediate space. To illustrate this, Herodotus (II, 24) believes
that the sun-god is forced by the cold winds in winter to move to the warm
sky above Libya; and in 434 B.C. (about the same time) the great advanced
thinker, Anaxagoras, is arrested for blasphemy and exiled because he taught
that the sun must be a mass of blazing metal larger than the Peloponnesus!
Everything in nature had its god, whose action explained whatever happened.
If the Greeks had once realized the awful infinity of the universe their whole
outlook on nature would have changed, and I cannot think that so highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
intellectual a people would not have been moved by wonder. I cannot
see any element in “the Greek genius” that would indicate this. (Observe
Ptolemy’s epigram on <a href="#Page_10">p. 10</a>.)</p>

<p>Returning to the Sappho quotation, Mr. Livingstone translates
ἦρος ἄγγελος literally as “the messenger of spring.” Does he mean the
messenger “sent by spring” or “announcing spring”? Presumably he does
not mean the latter, as it would impute intelligence or emotion to the bird.
But, if we accept the former interpretation, it leads to the curious result
that the poet, not content with a Goddess of Spring and the Hours who
represent the seasons, intends still further to personify spring. Is not
the true meaning of Sappho’s words “the nightingale with its passionate
song sent (by Proserpine) to let men know that spring is approaching”?
This is not mere captious criticism. To Sappho the goddess Proserpine
was a concrete being with some sort of corporeal form, who brings a <i>thing</i>
called spring, and who actually <i>does</i> send the nightingale ahead to sing
of the passion of the pairing-time, and thus let men know that spring is
coming. There is no poetic imagery, no imaginative picture in the poet’s
mind, but the statement of an <i>actual fact</i>. See also the reference to the
halcyon, <a href="#Page_370">p. 370</a>. It seems to me that, in this as in other cases, our classical
authorities <i>fail to place themselves in the position of the Greeks</i>. Here they
interpret as imagination what was meant as reality. (However, as I have
said before, the above are merely suggestions which I myself hope to consider
further; but, until we knew exactly what Sappho’s verse meant,
it could not be brought into the discussion of Mr. Livingstone’s views.)</p>

<p>A fine expression of a familiar fact. Under the influence of love,
anger, or other strong passion, a man becomes an unreasoning animal,
and actually <i>hates</i> to be told the truth. Wild passion glares through the
bars of its self-constituted cage at philosophy standing calm, lofty, and
serene. Only “when the fire is dying in the grate” do we again become
akin to cold, dispassionate, star-like Philosophy.</p>

<p>The triumph of machinery is when man wonders at his own
works; thus, says Derwent Coleridge, all science begins in wonder
and ends in wonder, but the first is the wonder of ignorance, the
last that of adoration.</p>

<p>If the collective energies of the universe are identified with
Divine Will, and the system is thus animate with an eternal
consciousness as its moulding life, the conception we frame of
its history will conform itself to our experience of intellectual
volition. It is in origination, in disposing of new conditions,
in setting up order by differentiation, that the mind exercises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
its highest function. When the product has been obtained,
and a definite method of procedure established, the strain upon
us is relaxed, habit relieves the constant demand for creation,
and at length the rules of a practised art almost execute themselves.
As the intensely voluntary thus works itself off into the automatic,
thought, liberated from this reclaimed and settled province
breaks into new regions, and ascends to ever higher problems:
its supreme life being beyond the conquered and legislated
realm, while a lower consciousness, if any at all, suffices for the
maintenance of its ordered mechanism. Yet all the while it
is one and the same mind that, under different modes of activity,
thinks the fresh thoughts and carries on the old usages. Does
anything forbid us to conceive similarly of the cosmical development;
that it started from the freedom of indefinite possibilities
and the ubiquity of universal consciousness; that, as intellectual
exclusions narrowed the field, and traced the definite lines of
admitted movement, the tension of purpose, less needed on these,
left them as the habits of the universe, and operated rather for
higher and ever higher ends not yet provided for; that the more
mechanical, therefore, a natural law may be, the further is it
from its source; and that the inorganic and unconscious portion
of the world, instead of being the potentiality of the organic
and conscious, is rather its residual precipitate, formed as the
Indwelling Mind of all concentrates an intenser aim on the upper
margin of the ordered whole, and especially on the inner life
of natures that can resemble him?</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">James Martineau</span> (1805-1900) (<i>Modern Materialism</i>).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>The remarkably fine and suggestive essay in which this passage occurs
was written in 1876, in the course of a discussion raised by Tyndall’s Belfast
Address. It is not easy to appreciate the speculation that Martineau
offers in direct opposition to the theory of Darwinism without reading his
preceding argument.</p>

<p>It may be well to begin with a quotation from his sermon, “Perfection,
Divine and Human”: “However vast and majestic the uniformities of
nature, they are nevertheless finite: science counts them one by one; a
completed science would count them all. God, however, is not finite;
He lives out beyond the legislation He has made; and His thought, which
defines the rules of matter, does not transmigrate into them and cease
else-how to be; <i>but merely flings out the law as an emanating act, and Himself
abides behind as Thinking Power</i>.”</p>

<p>In the present essay Martineau first develops the argument that
there is only one Power that exercises all the forces in the universe, whether
mechanical, chemical, or vital. That power is God, the Indwelling Mind
of the world. He is of like nature to (although infinitely higher than)
His highest product, which is conscious, thinking, and willing man. Seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
that God and man are alike in their natures, Martineau proceeds to draw
an analogy between the history of the world and the history of man’s own
development. The Divine Mind at first <i>consciously</i> exercises the forces
that we know as gravitation, cohesion, chemical attraction, etc.; just as,
to take a simple example, a baby has at first consciously to use its muscles
and balance its body in the process of walking. Later the baby, having
formed the <i>habit</i>, does all this <i>unconsciously</i> and, while walking, can pay
attention to other matters. So the Indwelling Mind of the world forms its
<i>habits</i> which we know as the laws of gravitation, etc., and is free to attend
to higher and higher objects. In this progress there is no evolution of the
organic from the inorganic, or of the higher from the lower forms of life.
Inorganic matter, having become subject to fixed laws, is precipitated and
dropped out of further conscious effort; also each lower form of life is similarly
laid aside as the Indwelling Mind proceeds to the higher forms, until
finally man is reached. The highest result thus arrived at is the production
of conscious <i>Mind</i>. All this involves what is usually known as Special
Creation, and the idea of “God at His working-bench” creating one
species after another is regarded as absurd. But it is not absurd on Martineau’s
argument, because the Indwelling Mind is constantly doing the whole
work of the world (and also because a fact to be accounted for by any
theory is that a higher form of existence <i>appears</i> whenever the environment
is suitable). In the present state of our knowledge Martineau’s speculation
cannot be proved or disproved, but it may contain the germ of a true scheme
of the universe—which scheme is yet far to seek. In any case, he makes
the important point that the nature of <i>power</i> in the world must be judged
from the best thing it has done—namely, the <i>minds</i> it has produced. The
idea of a blind, unconscious force is incompatible with the fact that <i>that
force has produced conscious mind</i>. It is the same argument as the Psalmist
uses, “He that planted the ear, shall He not hear? He that formed
the eye, shall He not see? He that teacheth man knowledge, shall not He
know?” (Ps. xciv, 9, 10.) The following (by whom written I do not know)
has the same idea: “Every thing is a thought, and bears a relation to
the thought that placed it there, and the thought that finds it there.” It
is interesting to consider Martineau’s suggestion with that of William
James on <a href="#Page_165">p. 165</a>.</p>

<p>The service of philosophy, of speculative culture, towards
the human spirit is to rouse, to startle it into sharp and eager
observation. Every moment some form grows perfect in hand
or face; some tone on the hills or the sea is choicer than the rest;
some mood of passion or insight or intellectual excitement
is irresistibly real and attractive for us—for that moment only.
Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end.
A counted number of pulses only is given to us of a variegated,
dramatic life. How may we see in them all that is to be seen
in them by the finest senses? How shall we pass most swiftly
from point to point, and be present always at the focus where
the greatest number of vital forces unite in their purest energy?</p>

<p>To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain
this ecstasy, is success in life. In a sense it might even be
said that our failure is to form habits: for, after all, habit
is relative to a stereotyped world, and meantime it is only the
roughness of the eye that makes any two persons, things, situations,
seem alike. While all melts under our feet, we may catch
at any exquisite passion, or any contribution to knowledge that
seems by a lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a moment,
or any stirring of the senses, strange dyes, strange colours, and
curious odours, or work of the artist’s hands, or the face of one’s
friend. Not to discriminate every moment some passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
attitude in those about us, and in the brilliancy of their gifts
some tragic dividing of forces on their ways, is, on this short
day of frost and sun, to sleep before evening....</p>

<p>We are all under sentence of death but with a sort of indefinite
reprieve: we have an interval, and then our place knows
us no more. Some spend this interval in listlessness, some in
high passions, the wisest, at least among “the children of this
world,” in art and song. For our one chance lies in expanding
that interval, in getting as many pulsations as possible into the
given time. Great passions may give us this quickened sense
of life, ecstasy and sorrow of love, the various forms of enthusiastic
activity, disinterested or otherwise which come naturally to many
of us. Only be sure it is passion—that it does yield you this
fruit of a quickened, multiplied consciousness. Of this wisdom,
the poetic passion, the desire of beauty, the love for art’s sake,
has most; for art comes to you professing frankly to give nothing
but the highest quality to your moments as they pass, and simply
for those moments’ sake.</p>

<p>In the Adelaide edition of this book this famous “pulsation” passage
appeared as originally written; it is now given as Pater afterwards altered
it.</p>

<p>Pater was a Hellenist and preached the new paganism of last century.
The Greek ideal life was supposed to be one of purely aesthetic enjoyment,
divorced from religious problems or from any sense of the <i>higher</i> in our
nature. Pater, however, altered his views, <i>Marius, the Epicurean</i>, being
intended as a recantation, and he became in effect an Anglo-Catholic.

<p>Is a man in a small Letter, yet the best copy of Adam before

His soul is yet a white paper, unscribbled with observations of
the world, wherewith at length it becomes a blurred note-book.
He is purely happy, because he knows no evil, nor hath made means
by sin to be acquainted with misery. He kisses and loves all,
and when the smart of the rod is past, smiles on his beater....
His hardest labour is his tongue, as if he were loth to use so deceitful

has outlived. The older he grows, he is a stair lower from God;

<p>A man can never do anything at variance with his own nature.
He carries with him the germ of his most exceptional actions;
and, if we wise people make fools of ourselves on any particular

a few grains of folly to our ounce of wisdom.</p>

afresh, and solemnly passing by and dropping off; I do not think
we should discern Him any more on the grass of Eden,
or beneath the moonlight of Gethsemane. Depend upon it,
it is not the want of greater miracles, but of the soul to perceive
such as are allowed us still, that makes us push all the sanctities
into the far spaces we cannot reach. The devout feel that wherever
God’s hand is, <i>there</i> is miracle; and it is simply undevoutness
which imagines that only where miracle is, can there be the real
hand of God. The customs of Heaven ought to be more sacred
in our eyes than its anomalies; the dear old ways, of which the
Most High is never tired, than the strange things which He does
not love well enough ever to repeat. And he who will but
discern beneath the sun, as he rises any morning, the supporting
finger of the Almighty, may recover the sweet and reverent
surprise with which Adam gazed on the first dawn in Paradise.</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">Charles Darwin</span> (<i>Letter to von Müller, June 5, 1879</i>).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>This letter is reproduced in the <i>Life and Letters</i>, but evidently Francis
Darwin did not know that the “German youth” to whom he says it was
written was Baron Ferdinand von Müller, K.C.M.G. (1825-1896), then
fifty-three years of age! Von Müller was director of the Melbourne Botanical
Gardens from 1857 to 1873, and died in Melbourne in 1896. He did
important work in Australian botany.</p>

<p>As regards Darwin’s letter, it seems to me that a sufficient reason
why a great and lovable man, who was at first a convinced believer in the
immortality of the soul, became an agnostic is given in the next quotation.
The higher aesthetic part of his brain had become atrophied.</p>

<p>Darwin himself thought that he had not given sufficient consideration
to religious questions and was exceedingly anxious that his own agnostic
views should not influence others,</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have said that in one respect my mind has changed during
the last twenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty, or
beyond it, poetry of many kinds, such as the works of Milton,
Gray, Byron, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley, gave me great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
pleasure, and even as a school-boy I took intense delight in Shakespeare,
especially in the historical plays. I have also said that
formerly pictures gave me considerable, and music very great
delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to read a line
of poetry: I have tried lately to read Shakespeare and found it
so intolerably dull that it nauseates me. I have also almost lost
my taste for pictures or music.... My mind seems to have
become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large
collections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy
of that (aesthetic) part of the brain alone, on which the higher
tastes depend, I cannot conceive.... The loss of these tastes
is a loss of happiness, and may possibly be injurious to the intellect,
and more probably to the moral character, by enfeebling
the emotional part of our nature.</p>

<p>For an Ague:—Make six middling pills of cobwebs. Take
one a little before the cold fit; two a little before the next fit
(suppose the next day); the other three, if need be, a little before
the third fit. This seldom fails.</p>

<p>A Cut:—Bind on toasted cheese. This will cure a deep cut.</p>

<p>A Fistula:—Grind an ounce of sublimate mercury as fine as
possible.... (Two quarts of water to be added, then half a
spoonful with two spoonfuls of water to be taken fasting every
other day), ... In forty days this will also cure any cancer, any
old sore or King’s evil.</p>

<p><i>The Iliac Passion</i>:—Hold a live puppy constantly on the belly.</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">John Wesley</span> (<i>Primitive Physic.</i> Ed. 1780).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>The iliac passion, now known as <i>ileus</i>, is a severe colic due to intestinal
obstruction.</p>

<p>It seems strange that so eminent a man should have believed in these
absurd prescriptions, but as a matter of fact the book generally is much
more sane and sound than one would expect from the habits and state of
knowledge of the time. For example, in his rules of health Wesley strongly
advises the practice of <i>cold bathing</i>, cleanliness, open-air exercise, moderation
of food, etc. Also these prescriptions are chosen for their absurdity—in
each case other more sensible remedies are offered. But Wesley in his
preface says that he has omitted altogether from his book Cinchona bark,
because it is “extremely dangerous.” This means that in regard to ague
he omitted the only efficient remedy—which was much more unfortunate
than his prescribing cobweb pills.</p>

<p>This book went to <i>thirty-six</i> editions between 1747 and 1840.</p>

<p>I think the deep love he had for that sweet, rounded blossom-like
dark-eyed Hetty, of whose inward self he was really very
ignorant, came out of the very strength of his nature, and not out
of any inconsistent weakness. Is it any weakness, pray, to be
wrought on by exquisite music?—to feel its wondrous harmonies
searching the subtlest windings of your soul, the delicate fibres
of life where no memory can penetrate, and binding together
your whole being past and present in one unspeakable vibration;
melting you in one moment with all the tenderness, all the love
that has been scattered through the toilsome years; concentrating
in one emotion of heroic courage or resignation all the hard-learnt
lessons of self-renouncing sympathy; blending your present
joy with past sorrow, and your present sorrow with all your past
joy? If not, then neither is it a weakness to be so wrought
upon by the exquisite curves of a woman’s cheek and neck and
arms, by the liquid depths of her beseeching eyes, or the sweet
childish pout of her lips. For the beauty of a lovely woman is
like music: what can one say more? Beauty has an expression
beyond and far above the one woman’s soul that it clothes,
as the words of genius have a wider meaning than the thought
that prompted them; it is more than a woman’s love that moves
us in a woman’s eyes—it seems to be a far-off mighty love that
has come near to us, and made speech for itself there; the rounded
neck, the dimpled arm, move us by something more than their
prettiness—by their close kinship with all we have known of
tenderness and peace. The noblest nature sees the most of this
<i>impersonal</i> expression in beauty, and for this reason, the noblest
nature is often the most blinded to the character of the
woman’s soul that the beauty clothes. Whence, I fear, the
tragedy of human life is likely to continue for a long time to
come in spite of mental philosophers who are ready with the
best receipts for avoiding all mistakes of the kind.</p>

<p>The degree of vision that dwells in a man is a correct measure
of the man. If called to define Shakespeare’s faculty, I should
say superiority of Intellect, and think I had included all
under that. What indeed are faculties? We talk of faculties
as if they were distinct, things separable; as if a man had intellect,
imagination, fancy, &amp;c., as he has hands, feet, and arms. That
is a capital error. Then again, we hear of a man’s “intellectual
nature,” and of his “moral nature,” as if these again were divisible
and existed apart.... We ought to know, and to keep forever
in mind, that these divisions are at bottom but <i>names</i>; that man’s
spiritual nature, the vital Force which dwells in him, is essentially
one and indivisible; that what we call imagination, fancy, understanding,
and so forth, are but different figures of the same
Power of Insight, all indissolubly connected with each other,
physiognomically related; that if we knew one of them, we might
know all of them. Morality itself, what we call the moral quality
of a man, what is this but another <i>side</i> of the one vital
Force whereby he is and works?.... Without hands a man
might have feet, and could still walk: but, consider it,—without
morality, intellect were impossible for him; a thoroughly <i>immoral</i>
man could not know anything at all! To know a thing, what
we can call knowing, a man must first <i>love</i> the thing, sympathize
with it; that is, be <i>virtuously</i> related to it.... Nature, with
her truth, remains to the bad, to the selfish and the pusillanimous
forever a sealed book: what such can know of Nature is mean,
superficial, small.</p>

<p>Above green-flashing plunges of a weir, and shaken by the
thunder below, lilies, golden and white, were swaying at anchor
among the reeds. Meadow-sweet hung from the banks thick
with weed and trailing bramble, and there also hung a daughter
of earth. Her face was shaded by a broad straw hat with a flexible
brim that left her lips and chin in the sun, and, sometimes nodding,
sent forth a light of promising eyes. Across her shoulders, and
behind, flowed large loose curls, brown in shadow, almost golden
where the ray touched them. She was simply dressed, befitting
decency and the season. On a closer inspection you might
see that her lips were stained. This blooming young person was
regaling on dewberries. They grew between the bank and the water.
Apparently she found the fruit abundant, for her hand was
making pretty progress to her mouth. Fastidious youth, which
revolts at woman plumping her exquisite proportions on bread-and-butter,
and would (we must suppose) joyfully have her
scraggy to have her poetical, can hardly object to dewberries.
Indeed the act of eating them is dainty and induces musing.
The dewberry is a sister to the lotus, and an innocent sister.
You eat: mouth, eye, and hand are occupied, and the undrugged
mind free to roam. And so it was with the damsel who knelt
there. The little skylark went up above her, all song, to the
smooth southern cloud lying along the blue: from a dewy copse
dark over her nodding hat the blackbird fluted, calling to her
with thrice mellow note: the kingfisher flashed emerald out of
green osiers: a bow-winged heron travelled aloft, seeking solitude:
a boat slipped toward her, containing a dreamy youth; and still
she plucked the fruit, and ate, and mused, as if no fairy prince were
invading her territories, and as if she wished not for one, or knew
not her wishes. Surrounded by the green shaven meadows,
the pastoral summer buzz, the weirfall’s thundering white,
amid the breath and beauty of wild flowers, she was a bit of
lovely human life in a fair setting; a terrible attraction. The
Magnetic Youth leaned round to note his proximity to the weir-piles,
and beheld the sweet vision. Stiller and stiller grew nature,
as at the meeting of two electric clouds. Her posture was so
graceful, that though he was making straight for the weir, he dared
not dip a scull. Just then one enticing dewberry caught her eyes.
He was floating by unheeded, and saw that her hand stretched
low, and could not gather what it sought. A stroke from his
right brought him beside her. The damsel glanced up dismayed,
and her whole shape trembled over the brink. Richard sprang
from his boat into the water. Pressing a hand beneath her
foot, which she had thrust against the crumbling wet sides of
the bank to save herself, he enabled her to recover her balance,
and gain safe earth, whither he followed her....</p>

<p>To-morrow this place will have a memory—the river and
the meadow, and the white falling weir: his heart will build a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
temple here; and the skylark will be its high-priest, and the
old blackbird its glossy-gowned chorister, and there will be a
sacred repast of dewberries.</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>There is an infinite pathos in these lines. Having lost her faith in a
future life, George Eliot tries to find consolation in the thought that, when
she has passed into nothingness—when she “joins the choir invisible”—she
will have done something to ennoble the minds of those who come after
her. But why should generation after generation of insect-lives waste
themselves in raising and purifying the minds of the generations that follow,
if all in turn pass into nothingness? The higher and purer men became,
the more they would love their fellow-beings and the more they would
shudder at the insensate pain and cruelty in the world—the physical
torture they themselves endure, and the mental torture both of losing for
ever those they love and of seeing the sufferings of others. One should
act in conformity with one’s belief. Instead of thus adding greater pain
and sorrow to each succeeding generation, the effort should be to coarsen
and brutalize our natures, so that love, duty, and moral aspiration shall
disappear, and we shall cease to be saddened by the appalling cruelty of
our existence. Our lives should, in fact, correspond with the brutal, ugly
and stupid scheme of the universe.</p>

<p>This is the direct answer to George Eliot, allowing her very important
assumption <i>that we have a duty towards others</i>, including those who come
after us. But this assumption is logically unwarranted, if at the end of
our brief years we pass into nothingness and have no further concern with
any living being. This brings us to a familiar train of argument. Why
should we be irresistibly impelled to sacrifice ourselves for the good of
others? And, apart from altruism, why should we develop <i>our own</i>
higher attributes—why seek to ennoble our own selves, since those selves
disappear? Why fill with jewels the hollow log that is to be thrown on the
fire? Why are we swayed by a sense of honour, a desire for justice, a love
of purity and truth and beauty, a craving for affection, a thirst for knowledge,
which persist up to the very gates of death? To take an illustration
of Edward Caird’s, is not the path of life which is so traversed like the
path of a star to the astronomer, which enables him to prophesy its future
course—beyond the end which hides it from our eyes? Otherwise, to use
another simile, it is as though Pheidias spent his life sculpturing in snow.</p>

<p>(This does not mean, as the sceptic usually sneers, that the virtuous
man merely desires a reward for his virtuous conduct. It is an inquiry
why he <i>is</i> virtuous—what is a sane view of the scheme of the universe.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>In forming the conclusion that there was no possible future for man,
George Eliot and an immense number of other thinkers of her time made
also the vast assumption that there was nothing left to discover. Blanco
White’s sonnet alone might have taught them the folly of such premature
judgments. Or we may take an illustration, used by F. W. H. Myers,
namely, the discovery that, far beyond the red and the violet of the spectrum
or the rainbow, extend rays that have been (and will for ever be) invisible
to our eyes. Since George Eliot’s time the Society for Psychical Research
has during the last thirty-five years accumulated unanswerable evidence
of survival after death.</p>

<p>We may well begin to doubt whether the known and the natural
can suffice for human life. No sooner do we try to think so than
pessimism raises its head. The more our thoughts widen and
deepen, as the universe grows upon us and we become accustomed
to boundless space and time, the more petrifying is the contrast
of our own insignificance, the more contemptible become the pettiness,
shortness, fragility of the individual life. A moral paralysis
creeps upon us. For awhile we comfort ourselves with the
notion of self-sacrifice; we say, what matter if I pass, let me
think of others! But the <i>other</i> has become contemptible no less
than the self; all human griefs alike seem little worth assuaging,
human happiness too paltry at the best to be worth increasing.
The whole moral world is reduced to a point; good and evil,
right and wrong become infinitesimal ephemeral matters, while
eternity and infinity remain attributes of that only which is
outside the sphere of morality. Life becomes more intolerable
the more we know and discover, so long as everything widens
and deepens except our own duration, and that remains as pitiful
as ever. The affections die away in a world where everything
great and enduring is cold; they die of their own conscious
feebleness and bootlessness.</p>

<p>(Speaking of the rare and exalted nature of Dorothea, who
has adopted the normal, domestic married life) Her finely-touched
spirit had still its fine issues, though they were not widely
visible. Her full nature, like that river of which Cyrus broke the
strength, spent itself in channels which had no great name on
the earth. But the effect of her being on those around her was
incalculably diffusive; for the growing good of the world is partly
dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with
you and me, as they might have been, is half owing to the
number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited
tombs.</p>

<p>This passage, which finely expresses an important truth, is at the
end of <i>Middlemarch</i>. The reference is to a story of Herodotus. He says
that Cyrus, the Persian, was angry with the river Gyndes (Diyalah), because
it had drowned one of the white horses, which, as being sacred to the sun,
accompanied the expedition. He, therefore, employed his army to divert
the river into 360 channels (representing the number of days in the year).
The story was probably told to Herodotus as explaining the great irrigation
system that existed in Mesopotamia. The Diyalah flows into the Tigris
not far from Baghdad.</p>

<p>But to come again unto Apelles, this was his manner and custom
besides, which he perpetually observed, that no day went over his
head, but what businesse soever he had otherwise to call him away,
he would make one draught or other (and never misse) for to
exercise his hand and keepe it in use, inasmuch as from him
grew the proverbe, <i>Nulla dies sine linea</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Be alwaies doing
somewhat, though you doe but draw a line. His order was when he
had finished a piece of work or painted table, and layd it out of his
hand, to set it forth in some open gallerie or thorowfare, to be
seen of folke that passed by, and himselfe would lie close behind
it to hearken what faults were found therewith; preferring the
judgment of the common people before his owne, and imagining
they would spy more narrowly, and censure his doings sooner
than himselfe: and as the tale is told, it fell out upon a time,
that a shoomaker as he went by seemed to controlle his workmanship
about the shoo or pantofle that he had made to a picture,
and namely, that there was one latchet fewer than there should
be: Apelles acknowledging that the man said true indeed,
mended that fault by the next morning, and set forth his table
as his manner was. The same shoomaker comming again
the morrow after, and finding the want supplied which he noted
the day before, took some pride unto himselfe, that his former
admonition had sped so well, and was so bold as to cavil at somewhat
about the leg. Apelles could not endure that, but putting
forth his head from behind the painted table, and scorning thus
to be checked and reproved, Sirrha (quoth hee) remember you
are but a shoomaker, and therefore meddle no higher I advise you,
than with shoos. Which words also of his came afterwards
to be a common proverbe, <i>Ne sutor ultra crepidam</i>.</p>

<p>Imperfection is in some sort essential to all that we know of
life. It is the sign of life in a mortal body, that is to say, of a state
of progress and change. Nothing that lives is, or can be, rigidly
perfect; part of it is decaying, part nascent. The foxglove
blossom—a third part bud; a third part past, a third part in
full bloom—is a type of the life of this world. And in all things
that live there are certain irregularities and deficiencies which are
not only signs of life, but sources of beauty. No human face
is exactly the same in its lines on each side, no leaf perfect in its
lobes, no branch in its symmetry. All admit irregularity as they
imply change; and to banish imperfection is to destroy expression,
to check exertion, to paralyze vitality. All things are literally
better, lovelier, and more beloved for the imperfections which
have been divinely appointed, that the law of human life may be
Effort, and the law of human judgment, Mercy.</p>

<p>This charmingly extravagant praise of a lady’s beauty recalls the

sent for the Persian poet Hafiz and very angrily asked him, “Art thou

for the black mole on thy mistress’s cheek?” Hafiz, however, cleverly
escaped trouble by replying, “Yes, sire, I always give freely, and in consequence
am now reduced to poverty. May I crave your kind assistance?”
Timur was amused at the reply and made the poet a present. The story,
however, is considered doubtful, because Timur did not conquer Persia
until some years after 1388, which is supposed to be the date of the poet’s
death.</p>

<p class="center">GLADSTONE AND THE SOCIETY FOR
PSYCHICAL RESEARCH.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone’s relation to Psychical Research affords one
more illustration of the width and force of his intellectual sympathies.
Many men, even of high ability, if convinced as Mr. Gladstone
was of the truth and sufficiency of the Christian revelation,
permit themselves to ignore these experimental approaches to
spiritual knowledge, as at best superfluous. They do not realize
how profoundly the evidence, the knowledge, which we seek
and which in some measure we find, must ultimately influence
men’s views as to both the credibility and the adequacy of all
forms of faith. Mr. Gladstone’s broad intellectual purview,—aided
perhaps in this instance by something of the practical foresight
of the statesman,—placed him in a quite different attitude
towards our quest. “It is the most important work which is
being done in the world,” he said in a conversation in 1885.
“By far the most important,” he repeated, with a grave emphasis
which suggested previous trains of thought, to which he did not
care to give expression. He went on to apologize, in his courteous
fashion, for his inability to render active help; and ended by saying
“If you will accept sympathy without service, I shall be glad
to join your ranks.” He became an Honorary Member, and
followed with attention,—I know not with how much of study—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
successive issues of our <i>Proceedings</i>. Towards the close of his
life he desired that the <i>Proceedings</i> should be sent to St. Deiniol’s
Library, which he had founded at Hawarden; thus giving
final testimony to his sense of the salutary nature of our work.
From a man so immersed in other thought and labour that work
could assuredly claim no more; from men profoundly and
primarily interested in the spiritual world it ought, I think, to
claim no less.</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">F. W. H. Myers</span> (<i>S.P.R. Journal, June, 1898</i>).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>Apart from this interesting glimpse of Gladstone, it shows the importance
he attached to the work of the Society for Psychical Research. To the
severely orthodox, who think no evidence of life after death should be
sought outside “Revelation,” his opinion should appeal. Every increase
of knowledge is a further “Revelation.” In the Bible we are told of one
resurrection, and there is certainly no reason why we should not seek the
evidence of others. We should not shut our eyes and close our ears to new
<i>Revelation</i>.</p>

<p>The Society has been thirty-eight years in existence and is still insufficiently
appreciated. Hodgson said in <i>The Forum</i>, 1896 “There are
so many ways of looking at the world. It may be a speck in space, or a
huge cauldron with a graveyard for its crust, a place in which to get a
hunger and satisfy it, the fighting ground for a while of dragon or ape, of
Trojan or Turk, an evolutionary drama that must end in ice or fire. Many
things it means to different men. One is busy with earthworms, another
with stars, another with the splendour of the day or the strivings of the
human soul. Numerous investigators are hunting for further proofs
that we came out of the mud, but very few are seeking indications, in any
scientific spirit, of what may follow the toil and turmoil of our individual
existence here.”</p>

<p>Myers says: “The question of the survival of man is a branch of
experimental psychology. Is there, or is there not, evidence in the actual
observed phenomena of automatism, apparitions and the like, for a transcendental
energy in living men, or for an influence emanating from personalities
which have overpassed the tomb? This is the definite question,
which we can at least intelligibly discuss, and which either we or our descendants
may some day hope to answer.”</p>

<p>Swinburne introduced the new Hellenism or paganism, which was followed
by Pater and J. A. Symonds and ended with Oscar Wilde (<a href="#Page_310">see p. 310 note</a>.)
Here Time is the supreme god who wrecks Christian Churches, etc.</p>

<p>Although Swinburne had no important message to deliver, yet by his
wonderful mastery of metre and language he was of tremendous service in
transforming English Poetry (<a href="#Page_219">see p. 219</a>.) But in spite of the magical
effect of his new melodies, he was wanting in the art (of which Milton
is the supreme example) of varying his rhythm and accents. His extreme
regularity, notwithstanding the fine language and the splendid swing of his
verses, produces in his longer poems a certain effect of monotony. Swinburne
spoke of the “spavined and spur-galled Pegasus” of George Eliot,
but although she lacked his wonderful lyric melody, she was more artistic
and effective than he in varying the rhythm of her verse. However, the
immense influence of Swinburne on all subsequent poetry can never be
forgotten. Even the dreary Iambic couplet in his hands was transformed
into music.</p>

<p>There is the love of the good for the good’s sake, and the love
of the truth for the truth’s sake. I have known many, especially
women, love the good for the good’s sake; but very few, indeed—and
scarcely one woman—love the truth for the truth’s sake.
Yet without the latter, the former may become, as it has a thousand
times been, the source of the persecution of the truth—the pretext
and motive of inquisitorial cruelty and party zealotry. To
see clearly that the love of the good and the true is ultimately
identical is given only to those who love both sincerely and
without any foreign ends.</p>

<p>God is my witness, what hours of wretchedness I have spent
at times, while reading the Bible devoutly from day to day,
and reverencing every word of it as the Word of God, when petty
contradictions met me which seemed to my reason to conflict
with the notion of the absolute historical veracity of every part
of Scripture, and which, as I felt, <i>in the study of any other book</i>
we should honestly treat as errors or mis-statements, without in
the least detracting from the real value of the book! But in those
days, I was taught that it was my duty to fling the suggestion
from me at once, “as if it were a loaded shell shot into the fortress
of my soul,” or to stamp out desperately, as with an iron heel,
each spark of honest doubt, which God’s own gift, the love of
truth, had kindled in my bosom.... I thank God that I was not
able long to throw dust in the eyes of my own mind, and do
violence to the love of truth in this way.</p>

<p>(See G. W. Cox’s <i>Life of Colenso</i>, I, 493.) Colenso’s quotation, “as
if it were a loaded shell,” etc., is from Bishop Wilberforce. Cox mentions
elsewhere that in one of Wilberforce’s published sermons he speaks of a
young man of great promise dying in darkness and despair, because he had
indulged in doubt as to whether the sun and moon stood still at Joshua’s
bidding! Who, that went through the experiences of those days, can ever
forget them? We had been taught that we “must believe” every word
of the Bible to be divinely inspired or else be eternally damned. And yet
we realized that such belief was absolutely impossible!</p>

<p>Let a man be once fully persuaded that there is no difference

be said of the Bible, collectively taken, may and must be said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
of each and every sentence of the Bible, taken for and by itself,—and
I no longer wonder at these paradoxes. I only object to the
inconsistency of those who profess the same belief, and yet affect
to look down with a contemptuous or compassionate smile on John
Wesley for rejecting the Copernican system as incompatible
therewith; or who exclaim, “Wonderful!” when they hear
that Sir Matthew Hale sent a crazy old woman to the gallows
in honour of the Witch of Endor.... I challenge these divines
and their adherents to establish the compatibility of a belief
in the modern astronomy and natural philosophy with their
and Wesley’s doctrine respecting the inspired Scriptures.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="notes">

<p>This is from Myers’ <i>Poems</i>, 1870, and is one of a pair of sonnets. I do
not quote the first in full because its meaning seems obscure, but the last
six lines on the shortness of life as compared with eternity are as follow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Lo, all that age is as a speck of sand</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Lost on the long beach where the tides are free,</div>
<div class="verse">And no man metes it in his hollow hand</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nor cares to ponder it, how small it be;</div>
<div class="verse">At ebb it lies forgotten on the land</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And at full tide forgotten in the sea.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the second sonnet quoted above, Myers is not merely referring to
the Biblical account of the future life in heaven as consisting in endless
worship—which, if taken literally instead of symbolically, would certainly
mean a “drear eternity.” The suggestion is that there must be some
equivalent to work, thought, activity, progress, and definite aims to make
eternal life preferable to annihilation. (I am reminded here of a curious
statement made by the great Adam Smith, “What can be added to the
happiness of the man who is in health, who is out of debt, and has a clear
conscience!”) Myers ultimately came to the definite conclusion that the
future life will be one of continued progress.</p>

<p>His name, Myers, is purely English, not Jewish. This gifted man was
not only a fine poet, but also an important essayist and a remarkable classical
scholar. He, Hodgson, and others formed the small band of able men who
threw everything else aside and devoted their lives to Psychical Research.
Myers’ best poems appeared in <i>The Renewal of Youth and other Poems</i>,
1882, and it was no doubt a loss to poetry that during the remaining eighteen
years of his life he added little, if anything, more. However, he and Hodgson
considered that the work to which they had devoted themselves was of
the very highest importance. <i>Human Personality and its Survival of
Bodily Death</i>, the important work in which Myers embodied his conclusions,
was left incomplete at his death, but Hodgson, with Miss Alice Johnson’s
assistance, completed and edited it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>Myers was quite satisfied before his death, in 1901, that the evidence
collected by the Society for Psychical Research had already established in
itself the fact of survival after death. But the interesting fact is that
during the nineteen years since he “passed over to the other side” he has
apparently been the principal agent in adding greatly to that evidence.
There is every reason to believe that Myers has personally been communicating
and arranging and directing much of the evidence that has since
been given.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is not the essayist’s duty to inform, to build pathways
through metaphysical morasses, to cancel abuses, any more than
it is the duty of the poet to do these things. Incidentally he may
do something in that way, just as the poet may, but it is not his
duty, and should not be expected of him. Skylarks are primarily
created to sing, although a whole choir of them may be baked
in pies and brought to table; they were born to make music,
although they may incidentally stay the pangs of vulgar hunger....
The essay should be pure literature as the poem is pure
literature.</p>

<p>The teaching of Cornelius Jansen (1585-1638) led to an important
evangelical movement in the Roman Catholic Church. When, however,
the Jansenists became subjected to persecution, the usual result followed
that numbers of them became fanatics. The more corrupt the French
Court and Society became, the more frenzied became this fanaticism.
In 1727 the Jansenist deacon, Pâris, a man of very holy life, was buried
in the St. Médard churchyard, and shortly afterwards miracles were said
to take place at his tomb. In consequence large crowds of <i>convulsionnaires</i>
assembled there and very shocking scenes were enacted, men and women in
hysterical and epileptic fits and ecstatic delirium, eating the earth of the
grave and inflicting frightful tortures on themselves and each other. When
in 1732 the Court interposed and closed the churchyard some wit wrote
the above couplet on the gate.</p>

<p>The <i>ought</i> expresses a kind of necessity, a kind of connection
of actions with their grounds or reasons, such as is to be found
nowhere else in the whole natural world. For of the natural
world our understanding can know nothing except what is,
what has been, or what will be. We cannot say that anything
in it ought to be other than it actually was, is, or will be. In fact,
so long as we are considering the course of nature, the <i>ought</i>
has no meaning whatever. We can as little inquire what ought
to happen in nature as we can inquire what properties a circle
ought to have.</p>

<p>Let us reflect that the highest path is pointed out by the pure
Ideal of those, who look up to us, and who, if we tread less loftily,
may never look so high again.</p>

<p>One summer evening sitting by my window I watched for the
first star to appear, knowing the position of the brightest in the
southern sky. The dusk came on, grew deeper, but the star
did not shine. By and by, other stars less bright appeared, so
that it could not be the sunset which obscured the expected
one. Finally, I considered that I must have mistaken its position,
when suddenly a puff of air blew through the branch of a pear
tree which overhung the window, a leaf moved, and there was the
star behind the leaf.</p>

<p>At present the endeavour to make discoveries is like gazing
at the sky up through the boughs of an oak. Here a beautiful
star shines clearly; here a constellation is hidden by a branch;
a universe by a leaf. Some mental instrument or organon is
required to enable us to distinguish between the leaf which
may be removed and a real void; when to cease to look in one
direction, and to work in another.... There are infinities
to be known, but they are hidden by a leaf.</p>

<p>This was first published in 1732 as “The Fly—An Anachreontick” and
Mr. Gosse in the <i>Encyc. Britt.</i> gave the first six lines as an example of an
Anacreontic. He attributed the poem to Oldys, but the authorship is
doubtful. (See <i>Notes and Queries, 3rd Ser., I, 21</i>). Vincent Bourne in a copy
of his <i>Poematia</i>, 1734, in my possession, has written out <i>and signed</i> the two
verses, entitling them “A Song,” the last line of each verse being repeated
as a refrain. From this it might appear that he claimed the authorship.
In 1743 he published a Latin version of the poem. Vincent Bourne, a
beautiful Latinist, was much loved by his pupils, Charles Lamb and
Cowper, who each translated into English some of his fine Latin verses.</p>

<p>Just as a poet, besides imagination, must have intellect or judgment
as a basis, so the higher imaginative faculty comes to the aid of intellect
in other departments of life. As Maudsley says, “it performs the initial
and essential functions in every branch of human development” (<i>Body
and Will</i>). Ehrlich, seeking a substance that would destroy germs without
injuring the human tissues, plods through endless tedious processes, and
on his 606th experiment, discovers salvarsan, a cure for syphilis. Here
the higher faculty has had little to do—but when, on the fall of an apple,
Newton’s mind saw in a flash how the world was balanced, intellect soared
aloft on the wings of imagination.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As well Poets as Poesie are despised, and the name become,
of honourable infamous, subject to scorne and derision, and rather
a reproach than a prayse to any that useth it: for commonly
whoso is studious in the Arte or shewes himselfe excellent in it,
they call him in disdayne a <i>phantasticall</i>: and a light-headed
or phantasticall man (by conversion) they call a Poet.... Of
such among the Nobilitie or gentrie as be very well seene in many
laudable sciences, and especially in Poesie, it is so come to passe
that they have no courage to write and if they have, yet are they
loath to be a-known of their skill. So as I know very many notable
Gentlemen in the Court that have written commendably and
suppressed it agayne, or else suffred it to be publisht without
their owne names to it: as if it were a discredit for a gentleman
to seeme learned, and to shew himselfe amorous of any good Arte.</p>

<p class="attribution"><span class="smcap">George Puttenham</span> (<i>The Arte of English Poesie</i>, 1589).</p>

<div class="notes">

<p>We do not always remember in what disheartening conditions the
great Elizabethan literature was produced—the inferior position of the
writer, his wretched remuneration and his dependence on patrons. It is
strange to think that it was considered beneath the dignity of a gentleman
to write poetry or to acknowledge its authorship—or apparently to show
proficiency in other arts or sciences. Such men as Sir Philip Sidney and
Sir Walter Raleigh were exceptions. The curious fact is that Puttenham
himself (assuming, as is probable, that he was the author) issued this
important book anonymously. He had, however, acknowledged his
<i>Partheniades</i> ten years before.</p>

<p>As Arber points out, the above passage, and another reference by
Puttenham to the same subject, indicate that, at least in the earlier Elizabethan
period, much talent must have been lost and much literature
never reached the printing press. The same feeling that then existed is
seen again in Locke’s time (<a href="#Page_180">see p. 180</a>), and, if we consider a moment, we
shall find that <i>it has persisted to some extent to the present day</i>. Think how
miserably inadequate is the attention paid to poetry in our educational
system, the methods employed being, indeed, calculated to make the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
student <i>loathe</i> the subject. (When I was young (“Ah, woful When”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>)
we had as a school text-book Palgrave’s Golden Treasury—a divine gift
to us in those days. As we had a sympathetic teacher, we read it <i>as poetry</i>,
and the consequence was that I and other boys knew the book practically
by heart from cover to cover.)</p>

<p>It is surprising that Englishmen neglect the one great talent which
they possess. What distinguishes them above all other nations is their
superiority in the higher imaginative faculties.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> This is shown in such a
national characteristic as the love of travel and adventure, which has
created the British Empire, and is <i>proved</i> concretely by the fact that England
has produced the greatest wealth of poetry which the world has ever seen.
This great treasure, which should be employed for encouraging the highest
of all faculties, is allowed to lie idle. The fact seems to be overlooked
that the study of poetry is not only of enormous intrinsic value in knowledge,
and culture, but that it is the finest of all mental training. By analysis
and paraphrase it gives knowledge of language, appreciation of style,
practice in literary expression, and, above all things, precision of thought.
In my opinion, poetry should form an essential part of education, beginning
in childhood and continuing throughout the Arts course. It may be found
that there are intelligent persons who are incapable of appreciating poetry,
and the subject may, therefore, not be made a compulsory one. But my
conviction is that, where men imagine themselves to be thus deficient,
it is the result of a bad system of education. There is great truth in Stevenson’s
fine essay, “The Lantern-Bearers.”</p>

<p>That early burst of admiration for Virgil of which I have already
spoken was followed by a growing passion for one after another of
the Greek and Latin poets. From ten to sixteen I lived much
in the inward recital of Homer, Æschylus, Lucretius, Horace,
and Ovid. The reading of Plato’s Gorgias at fourteen was a
great event; but the study of the Phaedo at sixteen affected
upon me a kind of conversion. At that time, too, I returned
to my worship of Virgil, whom Homer had for some years thrust
into the background. I gradually wrote out Bucolics, Georgics,
Aeneid from memory....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>The discovery at seventeen, in an old school book, of the poems
of Sappho, whom till then I had only known by name, brought an
access of intoxicating joy. Later on, the solitary decipherment
of Pindar made another epoch of the same kind. From the age
of sixteen to twenty-three there was no influence in my life
comparable to <i>Hellenism</i> in the fullest sense of the word. That
tone of thought came to me naturally; the classics were but
intensifications of my own being. They drew from me and
fostered evil as well as good; they might aid imaginative
impulse and detachment from sordid interests, but they had
no check for pride.</p>

<p>When pushed thus far, the “Passion of the Past” must
needs wear away sooner or later into an unsatisfied pain. In
1864 I travelled in Greece. I was mainly alone; nor were the
traveller’s facts and feelings mapped out for him then as now.
Ignorant as I was, according to modern standards, yet my
emotions were all my own: and few men can have drunk that departed
loveliness into a more passionate heart. It was the life
of about the sixth century before Christ, on the isles of the Aegean,
which drew me most;—that intensest and most unconscious
bloom of the Hellenic spirit. Here alone in the Greek story
do women play their due part with men. What might the Greeks
have made of the female sex had they continued to care for it!
Then it was that Mimnermus sang:—</p>

<p>Then it was that Praxilla’s cry rang out across the narrow
seas, that call to fellowship, reckless and lovely with stirring
joy. “Drink with me!” she cried, “be young along with me!
Love with me! wear with me the garland crown! Mad be thou
with my madness; be wise when I am wise!”</p>

<p>I looked through my open porthole close upon the Lesbian
shore. There rose the heathery promontories, and waves lapped
upon the rocks in dawning day:—lapped upon those rocks
where Sappho’s feet had trodden; broke beneath the heather on
which had sat that girl unknown, <i>nearness to whom made a
man the equal of the gods</i>. I sat in Mytilene, to me a sacred city,
between the hill-crest and the sunny bay....</p>

<p>Gazing thence on Delos on the Cyclades, and on those straits
and channels of purple sea, I felt that nowise could I come
closer still; never more intimately than thus could embrace that
vanished beauty. Alas for an ideal which roots itself in the
past! That longing cannot be allayed.</p>

<p>The wonderful record of Myers in classical study will first be observed.
If we did not know him to be absolutely trustworthy, we would find it
practically impossible to believe his statement. Imagine, for instance,
a boy of sixteen learning by heart <i>the whole of Virgil</i> for his own pleasure!
However, anything vouched for by Myers must be accepted as literally
true.</p>

<p>Extraordinary as this is, the above quotations introduce us to a subject
quite as extraordinary and far more interesting and important, namely,
the distortion of truth caused by extreme classical enthusiasm.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> It is
perfectly easy to see how such enthusiasm arises. Greek art and literature
are not only intrinsically wonderful and valuable but, seeing that they
were produced by a comparatively small population in a barbaric age, they
constitute the greatest (secular) marvel in the history of the world. Everything
tends to excite enthusiasm for this remote, alien, primitive, but
most remarkable people. I need not speak of the art in which they stand
unrivalled throughout the ages. As regards their literature, apart from its
intrinsic excellence and the beauty of the language in which it is written,
it has an additional fascination and charm, because it is the speech and song
of the infancy of the world. Through it we see into the mind and realize
the life of the most interesting race that ever lived. Possessing astounding
intellect and intense originality, they were nevertheless the children of
nature. Their earth was peopled with fauns and nymphs, their gods lived
and moved and had their being in every natural object—and they had
very little of our ideas of right and wrong. They had nothing of our wide
knowledge and experience, yet they constructed a world of life and thought
for themselves. It is absorbingly interesting to read their beautiful poetry,
fine literature, and philosophic thought, bearing in mind that it was produced
in the ignorant childhood and paganism of the human race, over two thousand
years ago. And one of the most astonishing things about them is
that essential product of civilization, a keen sense of humour. So curiously
“modern” is their literature that the writers speak to us across the ages
with as vivid a voice as if they were still alive. No other primitive race has
been able to leave us any such adequate conception of its life and thought.
Moreover, we can never forget how the Greek arose out of the tomb, where
he had slept for many centuries, to preside at the re-birth of our own modern
world—that emergence of Europe from medieval darkness which we call
the Renaissance. It was largely Greek art and literature that stimulated
the mental activity of the world and made us what we are to-day.</p>

<p>Very great enthusiasm is, therefore, warranted in the Greek student—but
there comes a point where enthusiasm may become pure <i>fanaticism</i>,
and lead to that most deadly of all things, the perversion of the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>In the above quotations two Greek poems are quoted, and another is
referred to in the lines I have italicized. The first two<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> refer to vice, which
to us is revolting and criminal, but to the whole Greek nation was natural,
and recognised by law. The third expresses even more revolting passion.
It will be seen, therefore, that Myers, in order to illustrate the “departed
loveliness” of Greek life made a strange choice of quotations (which also,
standing alone, would give a very false notion of classic Greek poetry).</p>

<p>Seeing that Myers was one of the purest-minded of men, what is the
explanation of this very remarkable fact? The explanation is simply
that Myers was a <i>classical enthusiast</i>. He had forgotten the warning
he himself gave in the first quotation. It is absolutely amazing how such
an enthusiast, however brilliant a scholar and capable a man in other
respects, can blind himself to the most obvious facts where anything
Greek is concerned. It is very certain that Myers read into each poem a
perfectly innocent meaning—and he would not be alone in that respect.
Take, for instance, the third quotation which is from Sappho. In my
youth the <i>great majority</i> of classical men appeared to have convinced
themselves that a poem of terribly fierce passion was an expression of
mere friendship! Even our leading reference-book, Smith’s <i>Dictionary
of Greek and Roman Biography</i>, gave the same absurd view until about
1877.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> However, we must get away from this ugly subject and seek
further illustrations elsewhere.</p>

<p>This perverted enthusiasm seems to permeate all books of the last
fifty or sixty years dealing with Greek life, art and literature that I have
met with. This is a very large statement to make, and, of course, I do not
mean that such flagrant instances as those above referred to are the rule.
But to me there seems always to be <i>some</i> bias which tends to exaggerate
or falsify the facts to <i>some</i> extent. We can trace this tendency back more
than eighteen hundred years to Plutarch. (<i>On the Malice of Herodotus</i>).
He, as Mr. Livingstone<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> says, “took the view that the Greeks of the great
age could do no wrong, and rates the historian for ‘needlessly describing
evil actions.’” And it is largely in this way that the enthusiast works—by
<i>omitting facts</i>. I should think few readers unfamiliar with the classics
will have known all the facts already put before them in these notes—because
such facts, although known to all classical scholars, are kept in
the background as much as possible. Again the tendency is to judge the
Greeks by their greatest men—to imagine every Greek to have been a Plato!</p>

<p>I might add greatly to what I have already said about the Greeks,
but I must confine myself to a few matters, repeating nothing that has
been said in previous notes. The Greeks had very little regard for truthfulness.
An <i>oath</i> was a matter of religion and was supposed to be binding
upon them, but it was excusable to twist out of it. They also saw nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
immoral in theft. Hermes was the god of thieves, and “the wily Odysseus”
was a favourite hero of the Greeks. Autolycus, the grandfather of Odysseus,
was taught by Hermes himself to surpass all men in stealing and perjury.
(<i>Od.</i> XIX, 395.) Hence it was thought quite a proper thing to make war
for the purpose of robbing neighbours of territory or property. I need
quote only the truly “German” opinions of <i>Socrates</i> and <i>Aristotle</i> placed
by Mr. Zimmern at the head of his chapter on Warfare in <i>The Greek Commonwealth</i>.
“But, Socrates, it is possible to procure wealth for the State
from our foreign enemies.” “Yes, certainly you may, if you are the stronger
power” (Xen. <i>Mem.</i>, III, 6, 7). “War is strictly a means of acquisition,
to be employed against wild animals and against inferior races of men who,
though intended by nature to be in subjection to us, are unwilling to submit[!],
for war of such a kind is just by nature” (Aristotle, <i>Politics</i>, 1256).
On considering that such sentiments are expressed by their greatest philosophers,
we are not surprised to find that <i>the history of the Greeks is one of
lies, perfidy, and cruelty</i>.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It further illustrates their unsympathetic
pagan character when we find the Greek mother mourning for her dead
son because he will not “feed her old age,” and Socrates valuing friendship
because friends were useful.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> When the enthusiast is confronted with
the debased Greek religion he tells us, or leads us to think, that the people
did not believe in their dissolute gods. As regards this I cannot do better
than quote the terse statement of Mr. Livingstone. After pointing out that
there were some advanced thinkers among the Greeks who were more or
less sceptics (and that there were also some small sects who are said to have
had higher <i>moral</i> beliefs than their countrymen<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>) he says, “We are concerned
with the state religion, which Athenians learnt to reverence as children,
which permeated the national literature, which crowned the high places
of the city with its temples, which consecrated peace and war and everything
solemn and ceremonial in civil life, which by its intimate connection
with these things acquired that support of instinctive sentiment which is
stronger than any moral or intellectual sanction.”<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Something may be
added to this. Why was the Greek so greatly concerned about his tomb
and his burial rites? The main reason why he burdened himself with a
wife and household was that a son should be left to see to those rites and
look after his tomb. He did not see his wife before marriage, and, however
beautiful he found her to be, the uneducated girl would be no companion
for him; and her beauty would soon fade in the unwholesome confined life
she led. Her office was fulfilled when she had borne him sons—and he
looked for his pleasures elsewhere. Surely this one fact alone proves that
the Greeks had a very real belief in their religion. Again why do we find
that only Socrates and a few other thinkers appear to have been charged
with impiety? Mr. Livingstone, curiously enough, argues from this that
there was greater freedom of thought among the Greeks. Surely the simple
and natural explanation is far preferable, namely, that there were <i>no
other pronounced sceptics</i> than those few advanced thinkers. Imagine the
danger of declaring anything against the gods which would throw in doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
the divinity of the patron goddess Athena!<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It is often argued that the
intelligent Greeks could no more have believed the monstrous stories of
their gods, than we believe some of the Old Testament stories of Jehovah.
But the position is entirely different. We disbelieve stories that offend
our moral sense: the gods of the Greeks had a character similar to their
own, and acted as they themselves would have acted if they had been gods.
Also they had no ethnology, no knowledge of purer religions to teach them
the falsity and depravity of their own—nor, indeed, would the proud
Greeks have condescended to learn from barbarians (especially as they
believed themselves descended from heroes who were sprung from the gods).
Finally one has only to read the accounts of travellers in Greece to learn
that the religion <i>even lingers on to-day</i>—see, for instance, S. C. Kaines
Smith’s <i>Greek Art and National Life</i> (pp. 153, 172), where the woodcutters,
when a tree is falling, throw themselves on the ground and hide their faces
in deadly fear of the Dryads,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and an <i>eminent Greek gentleman</i> crosses
himself at the name of the Nereïds. (See also W. H. D. Rouse’s <i>Tales
from the Isles of Greece</i>. I learn from the <i>Spectator</i> review of a book just
published, <i>Balkan Home Life</i>, by Lucy M. J. Garnett, that the religion
has a very strong hold on the people.)</p>

<p>My statement has been very one-sided so far, as I have said very little
of the virtues of the Greeks. These virtues were those of intelligent
primitive people, love of freedom, justice, and equality (<i>but confined to
their own nation and not including their own women and slaves</i>), personal
courage, great patriotism, fidelity to kinsfolk and guests; they showed
at times generosity to a valiant enemy and recognized some such duties
as burying the dead. While I do not think we can carry the national
virtues much further than this, there would be gradations of character
among the Greeks, and probably many would be more or less kindly,
others have a true affection for their wives, others show private virtues
in various directions—we can only conjecture as to something of which
there is very little evidence in their literature. On the one hand, we know
that Socrates suffered martyrdom for the truth,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and we may surmise that
there were other fine characters; on the other hand, we know that this
highly intellectual <i>nation</i> put the philosopher to death as a blasphemer
against their profligate gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>But while we can give the Greeks credit for little of the morality of
modern civilization, on the other hand we would be thinking very absurdly
if we regarded their vices as though the people were on the same moral
plane as ourselves. (This is the fact to be recognised. The ridiculous
tendency of the modern enthusiast is to depict the Greeks as a highly
moral nation striving for righteousness!) Strictly speaking, the Greek
practices and habits should not be called vices, because the Greeks had no
reason to believe that they were doing anything wrong. Their virtues
and their vices were those of ordinary primitive life.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The moral principle,
that highest product of creation, had not yet developed itself among the
people to any appreciable extent, but we see it gradually emerging in the
growing disbelief in the national religion among thinking men, and reaching
an advanced stage in Plato, the greatest philosopher of antiquity. But
to the average Greek, apart from religion (including respect for parents),
the patriotism which they had learnt from Homer, their one great book,
covered much of what they meant by “virtue”.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Whatever was good
for the State was a virtue, whatever bad for the State a vice. We can
hardly realize what Athens stood for in the Greek mind. For instance,
Æschylus tells us that the patron goddess Athena came to Athens to preside
over the balloting of the jurors and conduct the trial of Orestes, and also
that the Furies lived among the citizens in a sacred grotto. The Greeks
saw that they were immensely superior to the surrounding “barbarians,”
and they regarded their State practically as an object of <i>worship</i> (as Rome
was also regarded by the Romans).</p>

<p>It would have been interesting to discuss here the ethical views of
the philosophers, but the subject is far too intricate for this note—and
in any case they and their followers formed only a few exceptions among
the Greeks. It will be seen later that the use of such words as “virtue,”
“holiness,” etc., causes a vast deal of meaning to be read into Plato which
never entered that philosopher’s mind.</p>

<p>The great outstanding fact about the Greeks is their astonishing
intellect, combined with sound commonsense (σωφροσύνη) and a quite
modern gift of humour. Their powerful intellect, however, had very poor
material to work upon. In a previous note I have mentioned their remarkably
limited idea of the world—but, while knowing this to be a fact, we
still cannot realize the <i>mental attitude</i> of men who had even <i>one</i> false conception
of such magnitude as regards their general outlook and thought.
Let us take an instance of a different kind from the great philosopher
Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), who came after Plato—bearing in mind that the
average Greeks would be vastly more ignorant and superstitious than
their greatest thinkers. In his <i>Mechanica</i> Aristotle explains the power
of a lever to make a small weight lift a larger one. His explanation is that
a <i>circle has a certain magical character</i>. A very wonderful thing is a circle,
because it is both <i>convex</i> and <i>concave</i>; it is made by a <i>fixed</i> point and a
<i>moving</i> line, which are contradictory to each other; and whatever has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
circular movement moves <i>in opposite directions</i>. Also, Aristotle says,
movement in a circle is the most <i>natural</i> movement! Hence we get the
result: the long arm of the lever moves in the <i>larger circle</i> and has the
greater amount of this magical <i>natural motion</i>, and so requires the lesser
force! Again, let us take a story which was as firmly believed by Aristotle
as the most ignorant of his countrymen. Our word halcyon is the Greek
word <i>Alkuon</i>, meaning a bird, probably of the Kingfisher species. The
Greeks supposed the word to be formed of two words, <i>hals kuon</i>, meaning
“conceived in the sea”—therefore they believed the bird <i>was</i> so conceived
and that it was bred in a nest floating on the sea—and, as the sea must
then be smooth, they further believed that a period of fourteen days’ calm
necessarily occurred about Christmas—finding there was no such period
of calm around their own coasts they either thought that it must occur
(and the birds breed) elsewhere, or, like Theocritus, that the bird could
<i>charm</i> the sea into tranquillity.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The Greeks believed queer things about animals. I take the following
instances of birds alone from Mr. Rogers’ Introduction to his <i>Birds of
Aristophanes</i>, so that I need not give references. By looking at a plover,
who returns the look, a man is cured of jaundice. Penelope, the wife of
Odysseus, was said to have been so named because, having been cast into
the sea, she was rescued by widgeons (Greek, <i>penelops</i>). The song of the
dying swan was a belief of the Greeks. The raven was the bird of augury
and had mysterious knowledge. The cranes fought the pygmies and
swallowed stones for ballast. The young storks fed their aged parents.
The sisken foresees the winter and snowstorms. Mr. Rogers has no need
to discuss the yet more extravagant stories of the phœnix, sirens, harpies,
etc. Plutarch (<i>De Is. and Os.</i> LXXI) tells us how the Greeks regarded
birds and other animals in relation to the gods; he says that while they did
not, like the Egyptians, <i>worship</i> animals, “they said and believed rightly
that the dove was the sacred animal of Aphrodite, the raven of Apollo,
the dog of Artemis, and so on.” (Possibly Aristophanes’ comedy did not
win the prize, because the audience saw little humour in exaggerating the
powers which they really believed the birds to have. To the Greeks
the birds were <i>greater</i> and the gods <i>smaller</i> than we ourselves picture them.
Ruskin’s translation of Od. V. 67,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> the seabirds which “have care of the
works of the sea,” seems much more likely to be correct than the accepted
version that the birds live by diving and fishing. Consider how the Greeks
would regard the birds that flew round and over their ships or fishing-nets
and over the waves and rocks, where the sea-gods lay beneath—and compare
<i>Il.</i> II, 614.)<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>All that has been said about the Greeks in this and previous notes is
intended, not so much to exhibit the character of that nation—a matter
which does not greatly concern me—but for other reasons. In one instance
the intention was to indicate how vast a gulf exists between Christianity
and the ancient world. Many classical enthusiasts do not seem to realize
this, and a definitely <i>pagan</i> tendency is very apparent in their habits of
thought.</p>

<p>But the main object of pointing out the inferior state of civilization
among the Greeks, their non-moral character in certain respects, their
ignorance and superstition, and their low standard of morality generally,
has to do with the important question of interpreting Greek literature and
philosophy. It would matter very little that the enthusiast should picture
the Greeks as a race of saints and demigods, if there were no beautiful and
valuable literature to be coloured and falsified by reason of such views.
It is only by realizing the actual life and thought of this primitive race that
<i>we can understand their language</i>, that is to say, we can learn what meanings
should be attached to the words they use. Only thus can we <i>interpret
their literature</i>. We have already had two simple illustrations of this.
In one case what appears to be a poetic fancy in Theocritus, when the
voyager hopes the halcyons will calm the sea for him, is seen to be a wish
that the birds <i>will actually exercise the power that they possess</i>. The other
instance appears on page 294. But much more important is it that, in
reading words of knowledge such as references to the starry heavens or
the constitution of matter, or mental or moral phenomena, we should not
attribute to the Greek writer conceptions far larger and higher than he
had in his mind. To amplify what I have said in a previous note, let
us take the words in Plato, Aristotle or, say, Euripides which are translated
by such English words as “morality,” “purity,” “virtue,” “honour,”
“religion,” etc. It is clear that the original Greek expressions cannot
signify, for instance, either purity as we know it, or even abstention from
unnatural vice or from infanticide.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> We are, therefore, mistranslating
when we use such English words (because they are the nearest equivalent
to the Greek expressions), and this fact needs to be steadily borne in mind.
Again when interpreting, say, a Greek play, it is necessary to bear in mind,
not only the <i>supposed</i> character of the <i>dramatist</i>, but also the <i>actual</i>, <i>known</i>
character of the <i>audience</i> to whom the play was addressed. I now propose
to give an illustration which will bring me on dangerous ground.</p>

<p>Is it reasonable to ask if the Athenians, some few of whose characteristics
have been outlined in these notes, would have flocked to hear, and
have greatly enjoyed, a play replete with high moral teaching, and containing
hymns that might have come out of a Church Hymnal? Now the <i>Bacchae</i>
of Euripides, one of the most popular of Greek plays, and the <i>Hippolytus</i>
of the same dramatist, have been translated by one great Greek scholar,
Professor Gilbert Murray, in a manner that (at any rate, as regards the
<i>Bacchae</i>) received the “hearty admiration and approval” of another great
Greek scholar, Dr. Verrall. In this version, one after another of the debased
Greek gods is called “God.” We also find such expressions as (note the
capitals) “God’s grace,” “Virgin of God,” “Babe of God,” “God’s son,”
and even “God’s true son” (who is Dionysus or Bacchus), “Spirit of God,”
“Child of the Highest,” “Heaven,” “Purity,” “Saints” (who are the
Maenads!), “righteous,” “divine,” “holy,” and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Murray is put in a difficulty when two or more gods are
referred to. In some cases he becomes illogical (and reminds us of the
Kaiser), as when Dionysus has to say “God and me.” In others he has
to use the Greek name for one god, and then the words sound blasphemous,
as when he speaks of Dionysus who was “born from the thigh of Zeus
and now is God.” These instances are taken quite at random and there
must be many others.</p>

<p>Take the following two lines as a short illustration of Professor Murray’s
version:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Where a voice of living waters never ceaseth</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In God’s quiet garden by the sea.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The original reads: “Where the ambrosial fountains stream forth by
the couches of the palaces of Zeus,” or, to give them a more musical turn,
Mr. A. S. Way’s version is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Where the fountains ambrosial sunward are leaping</div>
<div class="verse indent1">By the couches where Zeus in his halls lieth sleeping.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Professor Murray’s two lines Zeus becomes “God,” “living waters”
is taken from the Song of Solomon, and “God’s quiet garden” from
Isaiah and Ezekiel. Such expressions, with their tender and beautiful
associations, do not in the least convey the sense of the original.
Used to describe the palace of a vicious, barbaric deity, they
are a <i>mistranslation</i>. Also every one of the expressions referred
to above is, wherever used, another mistranslation (although some
may be necessitated by the limitation of language). Again there are other
more pronounced mistranslations, some of which are pointed out by
Verrall (<i>Bacchants of Euripides</i>). Thus where the very old man Cadmus,
setting out on an unusual journey, merely says to his ancient comrade,
“We have pleasantly forgotten that we are old” (<i>Bacchae</i> 184-9).
Professor Murray interpolates a stage direction, “<i>A mysterious strength
and exaltation</i>” (from the god Dionysus) “<i>enters into him</i>”—and he alters
the words of Cadmus to conform with the miracle:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sweetly and forgetfully</div>
<div class="verse">The dim years fall from off me!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here, therefore, we find <i>an important episode</i> deliberately introduced
into the play.</p>

<p>Take another instance which Verrall does not mention. In the very
enthusiastic “Introductory Essay,” Professor Murray tells us that Euripides
longed to escape from the bad, hard, irreligious Athenians<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> of that day,
and proceeds as follows:</p>

<p>“What else is wisdom?” he asks, in a marvellous passage:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">What else is wisdom? What of man’s endeavour</div>
<div class="verse">Or God’s high grace so lovely and so great?</div>
<div class="verse">To stand from fear set free, to breathe and wait;</div>
<div class="verse">To hold a hand uplifted over Hate;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">And shall not loveliness be loved for ever?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>There is nothing here, nor in the translation that follows, to indicate
that there has been any interference with the text. It is only upon turning
to the notes <i>at the end of the translation</i> (which the average reader would
hardly study) that we find the third line is “<i>practically interpolated.</i>”
He gives reasons for this that are not easy to follow, and says “If I am
wrong, the refrain is probably a mere cry for revenge;” I add that the latter
is the generally accepted meaning, and the only meaning I can see in the
original Greek.</p>

<p>Now Professor Murray’s object in all this is to convey in words that appeal
to our minds his conception of the devout, religious and, therefore, <i>highly
moral</i> attitude of, not only Euripides, <i>but also his Athenian audience</i>. The
attitude of mind must be that of the <i>audience</i>, as well as the dramatist,
because none but devout, religious people go to a “Service of Song,”
and, as stated above, the <i>Bacchae</i> was a very popular play among the Greeks.
If, however, Professor Murray thought that, by colouring, altering, and
adding to the play, he gave a more correct impression of it as it appeared
to the Greeks, he was perfectly at liberty with that object to mistranslate
as much as he pleased—<i>provided he told his readers and hearers that they
were not reading or hearing the words that Euripides wrote</i>.</p>

<p>Has he told them this? The book is entitled “Euripides <i>translated</i>
into English rhyming verse.” In the Preface he also begins by telling us
definitely that it is a translation; later on he says: “As to the method
of this translation ... my aim has been to build up something as like the
original as I possibly could, in form and what one calls ‘Spirit.’ To
do this, the first thing needed was a work of painstaking scholarship, a work
in which there should be <i>no neglect of the letter</i> in an attempt to snatch at
the spirit.” He then goes on to tell us that “The remaining task” was to
reproduce the poetry of the original and (here is the only admission that he
has varied from the text) he ‘has often changed metaphors, altered the shapes
of sentences, and the like.... On one occasion he has even omitted
a line and a half’ (because unnecessary) and he says, he ‘has added, of course
by conjecture, a few stage directions.’ Let the non-classical reader look
back over what has been said above and ask himself whether such words—however
carefully studied—would have given him the least impression of
what this “<i>translation</i>” actually amounts to.</p>

<p>Without entering into any long discussion as to the so called “purity
choruses” of the <i>Bacchae</i>, let us simply ask the question, Does this pious,
fervently-religious version represent the actual play that the cruel, lying,
treacherous and unspeakably sensual Greeks flocked to see and enjoy?
Further comes a much more important question, Would such a “translation,”
put before English readers, or staged before an English audience,
give them a <i>true</i> or a <i>false</i> idea of the character of the Greeks?</p>

<p>I might compare with this Ruskin’s view of the Greek character
(<i>The Crown of Wild Olive.</i>). This is what he says the Greeks won from
their lives: “Free-heartedness, and graciousness, and undisturbed
trust, and <i>requited love</i>, and <i>the sight of the peace of others, and the ministry
to their pain</i>.” (Italics mine.) This is truly amazing! I am tempted
to go back again to Professor Murray’s <i>Euripides</i> (p. lxiii) and quote a like
passage:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>“Love thou the day and the night,” he (Euripides) says in another place.
“It is only so that Life can be made what it really is, a Joy: <i>by loving
not only your neighbour</i>—he is so vivid an element in life that, unless you do
love him, he will spoil all the rest!—but the actual details and processes of
living, etc., etc.”</p>

<p>The italics are again mine—but here it will be seen that Euripides
has, <i>as a matter of course</i>, anticipated the great evangel of Christ! He has
even gone a step further—but I must leave Professor Murray to his love
of the “details and processes of living,” whatever that may mean.</p>

<p>Finally, in this extraordinary essay, I come to something which is
absolutely <i>repulsive</i>. I must first briefly premise that the Dionysiac
mystery cult was not sectarian. It was orthodox, believing in the plurality
and the profligacy of the gods. Its adherents had no more idea of morality
or purity than other Greeks. Its rites were indecent. The so-called
“purification rites,” including regulations regarding continence, were simply
<i>training rules</i> preparatory to their hideous orgies. The essential rite of the
cult was practised by the Maenads or Bacchantes. They tore to pieces live
animals (and at one time human beings) and devoured their raw, quivering
flesh. As stated above, these horrible women are Professor Murray’s
“Saints.” He now proceeds to <i>draw an analogy between their loathsome god
Dionysus and Jesus Christ</i>! Thus Dionysus is born of God (Zeus) and a
human mother. He is the “twice-born”—having been hidden in Zeus’s
thigh after birth! He “<i>comes to his own</i> people of Thebes, <i>and—his
own receive him not</i>.” Again “It seemed to Euripides in that favourite
metaphor of his, which was always a little more than a metaphor, that a
<i>God had been rejected by the world</i> that he came from.” Dionysus “<i>gives
his Wine to all men</i>.... It is a mysticism which includes democracy, as it
includes <i>the love of your neighbour</i>.” Dionysus “<i>has given man Wine,
which is his Blood and a religious symbol</i>.” In the translation Dionysus
is called “<i>God’s son</i>” and even “<i>God’s true son</i>.” Reading this and
such statements as Miss Jane Harrison’s (<a href="#Page_292">see p. 292, n.</a>), one stands amazed.
Apparently this fanatical enthusiasm destroys the critical faculties, so that
the enthusiast becomes utterly incapable of appreciating the beauty and
value of Our Lord’s ethical teaching and its exemplification in His life.</p>

<p>For my last illustration of how enthusiasm affects our leading classical
authorities (and, therefore, leads to <i>perversion of the truth</i>) I take Mr. A. E.
Zimmern’s <i>Greek Commonwealth</i>. This, like Mr. Livingstone’s work, is a
very excellent book, which should be in all libraries.</p>

<p>Mr. Zimmern quotes and <i>definitely endorses</i> the well-known statement
in Galton’s <i>Hereditary Genius</i> (1869), which is as follows:—“The average
ability of the Athenian race is, <i>on the lowest possible estimate</i>, very nearly
two grades higher than our own, that is, <i>about as much as our race is above
that of the African Negro</i>.” (The italics are mine.) Here I have happened
by chance<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> upon an excellent illustration of classical enthusiasm, which is
worth while dwelling upon at some length. In the first place Galton’s
statement is perhaps the most absurd utterance ever made by an important
thinker; in the second place <i>it appears to have been accepted by English and
European authorities for nearly half a century</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>Galton bases his argument on the number of great men produced by
a nation in proportion to its population. He states that between 530 and
430 B.C. the Athenian Greeks produced fourteen highly illustrious men:—Themistocles,
Miltiades, Aristides, Cimon, and Pericles (statesmen and
commanders), Thucydides, Socrates, Xenophon, and Plato (literary and
scientific men), Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes
(poets), and Pheidias (sculptor). I take the minor objections to his statement
first.</p>

<p>He estimates the population of free-born Greeks in Attica at 90,000.
In this instance he was misled by the authorities of his time and is not to
blame; <i>but I take Mr. Zimmern’s own figures, as he endorses Galton’s statement</i>.
The 90,000 should have been, according to Mr. Zimmern’s more correct
figures, 180,000 to 200,000. <i>This alone cuts down Galton’s estimate of
the “average ability” of the Greeks to at least one-half.</i> Galton also excludes
the resident aliens who, according to him, numbered 40,000, but according
to Mr. Zimmern 96,000. Yet both these and the outside aliens must be
considered, for there were intermarriages. Themistocles and Cimon had
alien mothers, Thucydides also probably had an alien mother, or at any
rate was partly of Thracian descent, and there would be <i>some</i> ground for
the charge of usurping citizenship repeatedly made by Cleon against Aristophanes.
Galton also takes no account of the slaves, the number of whom
he estimates at 400,000, but Zimmern at about 112,000. These cannot
be entirely omitted when we consider the life of the Greek women and the
habits of the men. It should be remembered that the slaves were often
Greeks of other States and also by reason of the practice of exposing children
some would be Athenians and even of the best families (Plato’s <i>Laws</i>, 930,
deals with children of slaves and Greek men and women). However, on these
figures, it will be seen that Galton’s estimate has to be enormously reduced.</p>

<p>Next, the <i>greatest</i> of all the names in his list, Plato, has to be <i>struck
out</i>. There can be no reasonable doubt that he was not born until 428 or
427 B.C. (This appears to have been well recognised in 1869 and it is
unaccountable that Galton and his reviewers should not have known it.)
However, there is <i>some</i> evidence that he was born in 430, and let us assume
that this is so. But, if we are to include in the 100 (or rather 101) years
everyone who <i>is born</i> or <i>died</i> in that time, we are actually taking a period
of 200, not 100, years, and <i>doubling</i> the proper estimate! Besides Plato,
I may mention that Aristophanes and Xenophon could have been only
about fourteen years of age in 430, Thucydides had not then begun to write,
and of the eighteen plays extant of Euripides two only were written before
430. Here again is another enormous reduction of Galton’s estimate.</p>

<p>Again let us take Galton’s opinion of the ability of these fourteen men.
It is amazingly high. It will be seen that there are only <i>two grades</i> between
ourselves and the African negro. Again, in Galton’s table, “eminent men”
are <i>two grades</i> above “the mass of men who obtain the ordinary prizes of
life.” <i>He now places the whole of these fourteen Greeks two grades above
the eminent men!</i> To what starry height he means to raise them, it is
impossible to say, for the whole statement is exceedingly vague; but he
tells us that two of the fourteen, Socrates and Pheidias, <i>stand alone as
the greatest men that ever lived</i>.</p>

<p>It is clear then that the fourteen Greeks have to be placed at a tremendous
height in our estimation. It is impossible here to take each man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
discuss his ability, but let us inquire what qualifications Galton had <i>as
a critic</i>. We turn to his list of great modern English and European literary
men. Although he goes back as far as the Fifteenth Century and his list
comprises <i>only fifty-two</i> writers, he finds room among them for such names
as John Aikin and Maria Edgeworth! Again his ten great English poets are
Milton, Byron, Chaucer, <i>Milman</i>, Cowper, <i>Dibdin</i>(!), Dryden, <i>Hook</i>,
Coleridge, and Wordsworth. (Some names would no doubt be omitted
because they did not throw light on questions of heredity, but these lists
in any case are highly absurd.)</p>

<p>We need not greatly prolong this part of the discussion. We might
ask, however, what ground had Galton, for example, to place such men as
Miltiades, Aristides, or Cimon even <i>on an equality with</i>, say, Cæsar, Alexander,
or Marlborough. How can he class Xenophon as even <i>equal</i> to
our great writers? It is the interesting <i>facts</i> he tells us of, not his literary
ability, that makes this somewhat monotonous writer so very interesting.
(The important point to remember is that Greek literature has a very special
interest and value for us, quite apart from its great intrinsic <i>literary</i> value.
Taking De Quincey’s classification, <a href="#Page_227">see p. 227</a>, it is both “literature of
power” and “literature of knowledge.”)</p>

<p>Now take another point which I might illustrate from Galton’s own
pages. He tells us (in another connection) that about sixty years before
the time he is writing (1869) there were Senior Wranglers in Cambridge
who also obtained first classes in the Classical Tripos—and even at a later
date men could take high rank in both departments. Is it then to be
argued that the earlier men were the greater? Not so, but, as Galton says,
knowledge had become so far advanced that it was no longer possible for
a man to gain such a distinction in more than one of the two subjects.
Here we have the point—the world of knowledge and activity is infinitely
wider to-day than when it formed the subject of Greek speculation. Their
great men were very original thinkers—but <i>in a very few subjects</i>. Moreover,
they had no books to read, no foreign languages to learn. Even
their social and political life was far less complicated and involved than
our own.</p>

<p>Again, where we speak of “average ability,” it is not correct to compare
large populous countries, where great talents are often submerged (see
Gray’s “Elegy”) with smaller communities that afford far ampler scope.
Take my own State, South Australia, with its huge territory and a population
of under half a million, less than that of one of the larger English
towns. We have our Premier, Government, Parliament, Town Councils,
Heads of Departments, University, schools, judges, lawyers, journalists
and literary men, financiers, merchants, men who design and construct
railways, irrigation and other important works, mining men, heads of
institutions and so on—which means a large number of men of ability
and resource in all departments of life. If we compare ourselves with an
average half-million of Englishmen, how great our superiority would
apparently be! And yet, we know that we are not actually more capable—our
ability has been simply brought into play. Mr. W. M. Hughes might
himself have been a “flower to blush unseen,” if he had not emigrated to
Australia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>We have so far dealt with minor matters, which have nevertheless
reduced Galton’s arithmetical estimate by, say, 75 per cent. at the very
least. Let us now take the one great misrepresentation that must have
immediately flashed upon the minds of all reviewers of Galton’s book,
if they had not been blinded by classical enthusiasm. It is truly remarkable
that not a single one of them seems to have called attention to the
obvious fact that Galton takes the one great Athenian period, <i>as though
it were an average period in their history</i>! From Homer’s time to the Fifth
Century, B.C., would probably be about as long as from the Norman
Conquest to the present time, or from King Alfred to Shakespeare—and
there are again the many centuries that followed. Is the “average ability”
of the Greeks during hundreds or thousands of years to be estimated on
their one most brilliant period? The question needs no discussion. Galton
might in the same way have taken our Elizabethan period when London
had a population of 150,000, and Great Britain of about three millions—and
proved <i>that our own ancestors</i> were as far above ourselves as we are
above the negro.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Mr. C. T. Whiting, of the Adelaide Public Library, knowing how
my time was limited, very kindly volunteered to make an extensive search
for references to Galton’s statement in such of the literature of the time as
is available in Adelaide. In addition to a number of books, he has searched
through <i>thirty-eight</i> journals. He finds reviews of Galton’s book in the
following:—<i>Athenæum</i>, <i>British Quarterly</i>, <i>Saturday Review</i>, <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, <i>Chambers’ Journal</i>, <i>Journal of Anthropology</i>,
<i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, <i>Frazer’s Magazine</i>, <i>Nature</i>, <i>Times</i>, <i>and Westminster Review</i>.
The first seven do not refer at all to the statement—they apparently accept
it as a matter of course. Of the last five <i>Frazer’s</i> mentions the statement,
and says vaguely that the chapter in which it is contained “offers several
vulnerable points to the critic;” the <i>Westminster</i> states the fact without
taking any exception to it; the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> raises the question whether
Miltiades, Aristides, Cimon, and Xenophon were so very illustrious, and
enters into an argument on Galton’s figures; the <i>Times</i> considers that we
have had other men in different fields of human effort, who could be named
with Socrates and Pheidias, and lays stress on the enormous increase of
knowledge and activity in modern life; in <i>Nature</i> A. R. Wallace, misreading
Galton as referring only to the age of Pericles<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> admits the truth of the
statement as applied to the Athenians of that time. None of them refer
to the fact that Galton takes the most brilliant period of Greek history
as a normal period—and the arguments, taken together, amount to very
little. As regards the twenty-six journals which appear to have taken
no notice of so startling a statement in an important book, the fact seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
to indicate that to the writers for those journals the statement contained
nothing of a remarkable or dubious character! (Even <i>Punch</i> missed the
chance of an amusing cartoon!)</p>

<p>It may be objected that the reviewers of the book would not be classical
men. But <i>first</i> it must be remembered that the writers of 1869 would
practically all have had a classical education and <i>secondly</i> it needed no
special classical knowledge to see the absurdity of the statement. Every
one without exception would know, for example, that the period taken
by Galton was the one great Greek period. The statement must also have
excited interest on all sides. I myself remember how it was talked of when
I was a boy in Melbourne, and I have heard it repeated as an acknowledged
fact up to the present time—and, therefore, comment would have been
expected <i>in every direction</i>. But apparently the statement was generally
accepted. Mr. Whiting finds that in 1892, twenty-three years after,
Galton calmly repeated the statement word for word, <i>without reference
to any criticisms</i>. Again we find Mr. Zimmern accepting it as a matter of
course in his <i>second</i> edition in 1915. As it was in his first edition, which
would be reviewed in the classical journals, it must presumably have met
with no adverse comments.</p>

<p>But we have to go even further than this. Galton’s was one of those
important books that are studied by <i>all Europe</i>. Seeing that he makes
no mention of adverse criticism in his second edition, and Mr. Zimmern
sees no reason to qualify the statement, it is fair to assume that no serious
objection has been made in England or Europe during nearly half a century.
So amazingly does classical enthusiasm pervade the thought of the world!
I do not think I need say anything further on this subject.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Zimmern heads one of his chapters “Happiness or <i>the Rule of
Love</i>,” the “Rule of Love” being his translation of εὐδαιμονία! This
chapter is occupied exclusively by the famous Funeral Speech of Pericles.
I invite the reader to look through that terribly hard speech, and see
how much <i>love</i> it contains! Again to another chapter the heading is
“Gentleness or the Rule of Religion,” followed by two quotations which
are evidently intended to be read as parallel passages:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from the question whether the proud Greek could ever by any
possibility have become “lowly wise,” the word σωφροσύνη “temperance,”
“moderation”—or perhaps better still, “commonsense”—becomes
not only a “Rule of <i>Religion</i>” but even the highest conception
of Christianity, self-sacrifice. It is very extraordinary. Imagine the
<i>Greeks</i>—as we know them, and as Mr. Zimmern knows them—having the
faintest conception of what we mean by self-sacrifice! It reminds one
very much of Humpty Dumpty in <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>: “When <i>I</i>
use a word” (εὐδαιμονία or σωφροσύνη) “it means just what I choose it
to mean—neither more nor less.”</p>

<p>As this is my last note I am giving myself great latitude, but I must
not prolong it into a treatise. I shall, as briefly as I can, refer to only one
other matter, the Greek sense of beauty. I do not think it is an exaggeration
to say that we are given to believe that in this respect the Greeks are
exalted high as gods above the rest of mankind. What is the fact? <i>They
saw beauty in only one natural object, the human body.</i> In a land of clear
skies, wonderful sunsets, starry nights, remarkable for its ranges of mountains
and extent of sea-coast, they were (with some tiny exceptions not
worth mentioning) absolutely blind to any beauty in inanimate nature. Nor
did any bird or beast or insect, tree or flower appeal to them to any appreciable
extent as a thing of beauty. They admired only what was useful
or added to their comfort—the laden fruit tree, the shady grove, the clear
spring, the soft water-meadows.</p>

<p>Various explanations have been given for the Greek failure to appreciate
beauty in nature. Ruskin’s theory is most often quoted, that the Greeks
were <i>so familiar</i> with beautiful scenes that they could not appreciate them.
In the first place he forgot that it was not always the bright tourist-season
in Greece; they had their dark and wintry times. In the second place,
I have lived all my life in the southern part of Australia, which has much
the same climate as Greece, and I do not think there are any greater lovers
of nature than the Australians.</p>

<p>Is not the love of nature, as it came later,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> also <i>higher</i> than love of the
human form (omitting that facial expression which is an index of the soul)?
Our ideals of human beauty appear to be purely <i>relative</i> and depend on our
surroundings, while the same beauty in nature appeals to the most diverse
nations. Take for example the Japanese and Dutch artists who both loved
nature much as we do—yet they admired very different types of the human
figure. I understand that the Japanese, originally at least, regarded with
positive disgust our tall English beauties.</p>

<p>The beauty the Greeks saw in one object only, the human body, they
reproduced in statues which have never been equalled in grace and charm,
and are the admiration of the world. Their pure white marble statues
and temples seem to be always present in our minds and to transfigure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
our conceptions of the Greeks. We unconsciously picture them as a
race of glorious men and beautiful women moving in a city of marble.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
We find ourselves forgetting what we know of their character and habits—and
also forgetting the fact that both statues and temples were <i>painted</i>.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of colour through the effect of time, the flesh
effect has disappeared from their statues, and the chaste white marble
gives an idealized and spiritual conception of the utmost purity. As
stated before, this would be a conception quite alien to the Greek mind,
which saw no beauty in physical purity. If, when we stand in admiring
awe before that calm, majestic and exceedingly graceful and beautiful
Venus of Milo, we imagine her as the Greeks saw her, how different is the
picture! To begin with, the Greeks had little sense of colour, as is seen
from their limited colour-vocabulary. For example, one word <i>porphureos</i>
was used for dark-purple, red, rose, sea-blue, violet, and other shades even
to a shimmery white. Their colours were harsh, glaring, and put together
in shockingly bad taste (from our point of view). In temples and sculpture
reds and blues were the main colours used. In the Venus of Milo we must,
therefore, picture the hair painted red or red-brown, the lips a hard red,
eyebrows black, the eyes red or red-brown with black pupils, the dress
with borders and patterns of crude reds and greens or reds and blues. As
regards the flesh surfaces, we know they were wax-polished, but there
is no literary record or actual trace of any tinting or colouring. The effect
of the white marble would have been so horrible to us against the living
eyes and face, that Mr. Kaines Smith (being one of our enthusiasts) suggests
that the artist “might quite well” have used some colouring matter for
the nude parts of the figure! We must further picture the statue
standing in a temple, which must of course also have been painted. The
structure would have its borders generally of harsh reds and blues, and the
decorative sculpture of the pediments, metopes and friezes would be painted
in most inconceivable colours. Thus in the metope relief of the slaying
of the Hydra at Olympia, the hydra is blue, the background red, and the hair,
lips, and eyes of Hercules are coloured. I might go on to the Elgin marbles,
the greatest sculptures that we possess in the world, and show them gorgeous
in bronze and colour. (Armour, horse-trappings, etc., were attached to
the marble in bronze or other metal.) The two masterpieces of Pheidias,
forty and sixty feet high respectively, which have not survived to us, were
much more admired by the Greeks than the sculptures of the Parthenon.
These were in barbaric ivory and gold, with the same living eyes, red lips,
and so on. The fact is that the Greek, “builded better than he knew.”
He unintentionally produced objects whose <i>spiritual</i> beauty he was incapable
of appreciating and, therefore, he gave them a grosser form that appealed
to his own primitive sensual nature.</p>

<p>(Apart from this the Greek sculptor was very limited by the paucity
of his subjects. How tiresome are the never-ending Centaurs and Amazons!)<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>As regards Greek architecture, its ornament is a question of sculpture,
its structure is the result of intellect combined with a certain amount of
design due to their artistic sense of proportion. The Greeks did great
service to humanity in working out the principles of building—but, thereafter,
there was no scope for originality. Apart from its sculptural ornament,
nothing more monotonous could well be imagined than a series of Greek
temples, all of the same type and subject to definite, rigid rules of measurement.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Finally there are two matters I am bound to refer to in connection with
these rough notes. First, in merely enumerating the salient features
of a nation’s character, one gives no picture whatever of the <i>life</i> they led.
The Greek <i>men</i> led a highly intellectual, artistic, and on the whole a very
gay life. If we look around us to-day, we shall find among ourselves
Greeks, intellectual men who are moral sceptics, who simply do not understand
that moral motives exist, who do no act in their lives from a sense
of principle, and who live a purely material life (unless perhaps some great
crisis, the arrival of the angel of Death or some other overwhelming event,
awakens them to a sense of higher things). We can see something like a
parallel to the Greeks in the gay, immoral, artistic French aristocracy who
lived in the midst of a starving peasantry before the Revolution—or in George
Eliot’s fascinating renaissance story in <i>Romola</i> of the young Greek Tito
Melema. A man may be cruel, faithless and immoral, and yet live a gay
artistic and intellectual life—but it is not such a life as would have appealed
to Myers or to ourselves. Secondly, a clear knowledge of the truth about
the Greek character does in no way detract from the miracle of their literature
or of their art. It <i>adds</i> to the wonder of it all. (If one may with the
utmost reverence make another comparison, how can we fully appreciate
the wonder and beauty of Christ’s teaching, if we forget the conditions
of the time?) To find most beautiful poetry, fine literature, deep philosophic
thought, amazing grace and charm in art emanating from this primitive
race is purely astounding in itself. And it needs to be borne in mind that
even the men who took part in Plato’s <i>Symposium</i> lived in a different atmosphere
from our own, and had a very different conception of the physical
universe and the moral law. But this should <i>add</i> to our admiration, our
<i>veneration</i>, for a Plato who could rise to so great a sublimity of thought
in spite of such semi-barbarous conditions and surroundings. These men
also looked upon the world with younger and fresher eyes. We are two
thousand three hundred years older than they are. They knew very
little of the past history of the world and had only an insignificant fraction
of our scientific knowledge. If any religious doubts had begun to arise
in their minds, they still could not possibly have rid themselves of the belief
instilled into them since childhood—and they lived among Nymphs and
Fauns, and saw a god in every star and under every wave. Never had they
heard or dreamt of any Love of God, or Love of Man. It is only the
enthusiast who, by picturing the Greeks as a modern moral nation, detracts
from our real interest in them and robs their literature of its fascination.
If knowledge of the true Greek character were to destroy all our enjoyment
in their art and literature, even then truth must prevail “though the heavens
fall”; but the fact is far otherwise. The fuller our knowledge the more
we shall enjoy the greatness and beauty of their art and poetry and the more
absorbing will be our interest in their literature.</p>

hastily and without sufficient care. (The proceeds were to go to the Australian Repatriation
Fund, and the book was hurriedly put together and printed to be ready for a
Repatriation Day which was announced but actually was never held.) It was my first
experience in publishing, and I did not realize the care and consideration required in
issuing a book even of this character. Hence (1) part of my manuscript was entirely
overlooked; (2) I failed to see that many quotations would be improved by adding their
context; (3) I did not go properly through the great mass of Hodgson’s correspondence;
and (4) I, wrongly, as I now think, excluded many quotations because I thought certain
subjects were unsuitable for the book. Besides extending the scope of the collection
by including those subjects I now have no longer restricted myself to the seventy-eighty
period. The notes also add materially to the size of this volume.</p>

of the early Greek poets to compress a description into a series of epithets full of expression,
without connecting words—compare Tennyson (“The Passing of Arthur”).</p>

being shrewd, commonsense, practical business-men, “a nation of shopkeepers”—although
their entire history shows the contrary. That history is epitomized in such an
expression as “England the Unready,” or, in the King’s appeal, “Wake up, England!”
That they are idealists and dreamers can be shown by numberless facts. For example,
what have they supported in the sacred name of Liberty? The laissez-faire doctrine,
that law is an infringement of freedom, and, therefore, that cruelty, abuses, and absurdities
must not be interfered with; the theory that England should be the home of freedom,
and, therefore, that the scum of Europe shall infect the nation; the “Palladium of English
Liberty,” Trial by Jury, which means the appointment of inexperienced, irresponsible,
and easily-biassed judges; the economic policy, which, because it is falsely labelled Free
Trade, becomes a fetish against which no practical objection must be urged and no lesson
learned from the experience of other countries. On the other hand, our experience
in the present war is a proof that the imaginative faculties are more powerful than mere
intellect: for, when the Englishman bends his energies to the business of war, he soon
surpasses the German for all his fifty years’ preparation. <a href="#Page_39">See p. 39.</a></p>

and a particular period. Greece consisted of a number of States of which Attica was
one, with Athens as its centre. It comprised only seven hundred square miles, and,
allowing for its colonies, would be about half the size of Lancashire. Its great and brilliant
period corresponded roughly with the middle half of the Fifth Century B.C. A large
proportion of the finest Greek art and literature was produced by this tiny state in that
short period. This is the miracle of antiquity. It is to Attica during this period that my
remarks mainly refer.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_61" id="Footnote_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> Perhaps these woodcutters would not have entirely appreciated what Mr. G.
Lowes Dickinson (<i>The Greek View of Life</i>) says of the Greek divinities. He tells us
that the Greek originally felt “bewilderment and terror in the presence of the powers
of nature,” but his religion developed “till at last from the womb of the dark enigma
that haunted him in the beginning <i>there emerged into the charmed light of a world of
ideal grace a pantheon of fair and concrete personalities</i>.” (The italics are mine). The
classical enthusiast always pictures the Greeks as <i>living in fairyland</i>: actually the gods
and lesser divinities were to them for the most part objects of awe and dread. In this
“world of ideal grace” there would be, for example, the horrible Furies who dwelt in
their grotto in Athens!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_67" id="Footnote_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> A few days after writing the above I was walking along the sea-beach with friends,
and we came to a man and boy who were drawing in a net. It was a beautifully clear day,
and no seagull or other bird could be seen anywhere. I pointed this out to my friends,
and said, “You’ll see the patrol-bird arrive presently.” In a few minutes a gull appeared
from nowhere, flew round the net, and then, as though the business was unimportant,
flew away. The net when drawn in was empty! This is how the bird probably appeared
to the Greeks. When the net brought in a haul, and the birds clamoured round it for
their share, how very reasonable would this again appear to the Greeks.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_70" id="Footnote_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> It is necessary to emphasize this, lest the reader should think that these illustrations
are exceptional and the result of prolonged research. Actually I had no
memoranda or other material when I began the many notes to this book, and those notes
were all completed in ten months. For this note I simply took two books, Professor
Murray’s and Mr. Zimmern’s, to illustrate my thesis. I might have chosen far more
“enthusiastic” works than Mr. Zimmern’s excellent book.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> The whole argument seems to have little foundation. Are we to assume, for
example, that the “average ability” of the Greeks before and after their great period,
or of the English before and after the Elizabethan age, was enormously inferior because
the proportion of very illustrious men was so much less? Why should not the average
be higher, the ability (through intermarriage) being more equally distributed?</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_72" id="Footnote_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> If Galton had referred only to the Athenians of the great period, as Wallace
imagined, the statement would have been even more absurd. It would then mean that
an African tribe of blacks might suddenly become as intelligent as ourselves, continue
so for two generations, and then relapse at once into their old barbarism. Yet Dr.
Verrall went some distance in this direction, for he says the Athenians of the great period
“had plainly an immense superiority of mind in comparison with their predecessors.”
(<i>The Bacchants of Euripides</i>, <i>p. 168</i>).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_73" id="Footnote_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> I may add, however, one personal remark. I am quite well aware—and my
friends persistently and painfully impress the fact upon me—that this book will be reviewed
by gentlemen who have been imbued from youth with even greater enthusiasm,
seeing that the tendency has grown stronger and stronger since that time. Those reviewers
will probably feel shocked that the naked facts should be set before the general
public. I can quite understand this feeling, but I do not sympathize with it. Truth
comes first, and I have no sympathy with the feminine view of truth (<a href="#Page_343">see p. 343</a>), which
is the same as the Jesuitical view. I do, however, sympathize with them in one respect,
that the truth should be stated at an unfortunate time, when the beautiful Greek language
and its glorious literature seem likely to be put on a back shelf with Hebrew and Sanskrit.
It will be a sad thing if this should happen (I would much prefer to sacrifice the inferior
Latin, in spite of the special reasons for its study), but the first and last word always is—<i>Truth</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_75" id="Footnote_75"></a><a href="#FNanchor_75"><span class="label">[75]</span></a> It would be interesting to trace the earliest references to love of Nature. They
may, perhaps, be found in the Bible. In the Song of Solomon (which, however, in its
present form is now supposed to date back only to the Fourth Century, B.C., and, therefore
not to be by Solomon) we have the spring-song of love, with flowers and budding trees and
vines and the singing of birds (II, 10-13). Professor Naylor also reminds me of our
Lord’s Sermon on the Mount, “Consider the lilies, etc.”</p>

<p>I repeat here what I say in the <a href="#PREFACE">Preface</a> that Professor Naylor takes no responsibility
for any of the views I express in my notes on the Greeks.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_77" id="Footnote_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> Even as regards the human form Greek art is limited, as is seen in the Laocoon
where the boys are simply miniature men. (The Laocoon, although of very late date, is
nevertheless Greek with all the traditions of the art behind it.) I know very little on this
subject, but it seems to me that something of much importance yet remains to be discovered
about Greek sculpture.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
